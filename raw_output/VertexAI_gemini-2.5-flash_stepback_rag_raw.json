        "Patient Note": "The patient, a 22-year-old woman of Chinese Han ethnicity, was admitted for severe edema of the facial region and two lower limbs over 3 mo.\nThe patient developed edema of the facial region and two lower limbs 3 mo ago without obvious cause. Her symptoms were mild in the morning and severe in the afternoon. At the same time, she experienced migratory pain of the small joints, which improved after movement, as well as decreased urinary volume, weakness, and poor appetite.\nThe patient had a free previous medical history.\nThe patient’s temperature was 36.6 °C, heart rate was 78 bpm, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure was 122/80 mmHg, and oxygen saturation in room air was 98%. The patient was conscious and she complied with the physician's physical examination. Her heart, lungs, and abdomen examinations showed no significant abnormalities, no percussion pain in her kidney area, and severe pitting edema in both lower extremities.\nRoutine urine examination revealed the following: Proteinuria +++, hematuria ++; phase of urinary red blood cells: Deformed erythrocytosis 70%, urine protein quantitation 4.2 g/24 h; urea nitrogen 15.7 mmol/L, and serum creatinine 141.4 μmol/L. Routine blood test results were as follows: Hemoglobin 92 g/L, white blood cells 4.8 × 109/L, blood platelets 218 × 109/L, antinuclear antibody 1:3200, cytoplasmic granules 1:1000, ds-DNA antibody > 1:3200, C3 0.56 g/L, and C4 0.22 g/L.\nPathological results showed 35 glomeruli in the punctured renal tissue, including one with global sclerosis, two with ischemic sclerosis, and the remaining glomeruli with diffuse proliferation of mesangial cells and endothelial cells, accompanied by segmental dual-track formation of a thickened basement membrane, segmental Meyer's loop, leukocyte infiltration, and segmental microthrombus formation. Fuchsinophilic protein deposition can be found at the mesangial region and subepithelial region, including fibrin crescent formation of one cell. The kidney tubular epithelium exhibited granular and vacuolar degeneration, as well as multifocal atrophy. The renal interstitium showed multishaped lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, together with mild thickening of the arteriole wall. Paraffin immunofluorescence revealed: Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (++), IgA (++), IgM (++), C3 (+), fall risk assessment (+), C1q (++), and granular deposition along the mesangial region and capillary wall. Combined with clinical findings, this condition was considered diffuse proliferative lupus nephritis, with IV-G (A), AI = 11, and CI = 5. AI was scored as follows: Cellular proliferation (2 points), leukocyte infiltration (1 point), nuclear fragmentation/fibrinoid necrosis (2 points), cell crescent (0 points), Meyer's loop/thrombus (2 points), and interstitial monocyte infiltration (2 points). CI was scored as follows: Sclerosis (2 points), fibrin crescent (0 points), tubular atrophy (2 points), and interstitial fibrosis (2 points) (Figure ).\nAfter consideration of the renal puncture results, oral administration of prednisone was begun at 50 mg/d, and meanwhile, cyclophosphamide was applied through intravenous injection at a dosage of 1.0 g monthly, which lasted for a consecutive 6 mo and was stopped after an accumulative use of 6 g. The serum creatinine fluctuated within an approximate range of 120-160 μmol/L, and blood albumin fluctuated from approximately 29-35 g/L. Then, the patient began to take AZA 50 mg/d as maintenance treatment but experienced extensive alopecia and shedding of pubic hair on the 13th day after oral administration. Pharyngalgia appeared on the 14th day, and fever with a body temperature up to 42 ℃ occurred on the 15th day. The patient came to the hospital for the second time. Physical examination revealed the following: Body temperature, 39.4 ℃; pulse, 92 times/min; breath rate, 22 times/min; blood pressure, 182/100 mmHg. The patient exhibited clear consciousness and emotional distress; she presented scattered chromatosis on her skin, and a rash was found on the inner surface of the bilateral thighs. Pharyngeal congestion was noted, and the breath sounds of the two lungs were clear. The heart rate was 92 times/min. The abdomen was flat, soft, and free from tenderness or rebound tenderness, and there was no liver or spleen involvement. Routine blood work showed the following: Hemoglobin 72 g/L, white blood cell count 1.25 × 109/L, blood platelet count 13 × 109/L, lymphocyte ratio 95.7%, neutrophil ratio 1.6%, and neutrophil count 0.01 × 109/L (Figure ).

        "Ground Truth Answer": "47.039",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing GFR is 142 x (Scr/A)**B x 0.9938**age x (gender_coeffcient), where the ** indicates an exponent operation, Scr is the concentration of serum creatinine in mg/dL and gender_coefficient is 1.012 if the patient is female, else the coeffient is 1. The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 22 years old. The patient's gender is Female, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.012.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Serum Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Serum Creatinine is 141.4 µmol. To convert 141.4 µmol of Serum Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine. To convert from mol Serum Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00014 mol Serum Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine. To convert 0.01584 g of Serum Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.01584 g Serum Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 15.84 mg Serum Creatinine/10.0 dL = 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 141.4 µmol Serum Creatinine/L converts to 1.584 mg Serum Creatinine/dL. Because the patient's gender is female and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/dL, A = 0.7 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.584/0.7)**-1.2 * 0.9938**22 * 1.012 = 47.039.\nHence, the GFR value is 47.039 ml/min/1.73 m².",

This occurred in a symmetrical fashion and extended from the upper one-third of the calf to the mid-thigh. The patient had difficulty walking secondary to pain. He had undergone saphenous vein harvesting from these areas for his coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The patient denied trauma to the lower extremities, fevers, chills, and rigors. His medications include paricalcitol, sevelamer, calcium acetate, aspirin, amiodarone, amlodepine, simvastatin, and humilin 70/30.\nPhysical examination showed extensive erythema involving the inner aspect of the thighs down to the medial upper one-third of the calf on both sides (Figures -). Skin lesions were warm and very tender to touch, but there was no induration. Initial laboratory examination revealed white count 9,500 with 70% neutrophils, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 87 mm/hr, C-reactive protein 11.6 mg/dl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 57 mg/dl, creatinine 11.3 mg/dl, calcium 9.8 mg/dl, albumin 3 gm/dl, prothrombin time (PT) 11.3 sec, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 30.3 sec.\nHe was treated with intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone. By day three, moderate induration had developed, there were no signs of improvement, and the intensity of pain worsened. CT scan of both lower extremities was not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis and repeat labs showed a white count 15,700, with 75% neutrophils, and C-reactive protein 48 mg/dl, calcium 9.76 mg/dl, phosphorus 12.5 mg/dl (first time obtained). He required a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump to control his pain with little improvement. His antibiotics were changed to linezolid, tobramycin, and levofloxacin. On the fourth day, there was an increased induration of the thighs with rock hard consistency of the tissue. Skin biopsy was performed showing deposition of calcium in the small blood vessels of the skin, areas of fat necrosis with foamy histiocytes, and neutrophils consistent with calciphylaxis (Figures -). Parathyroid hormone level (PTH) was 628 pg/ml.\nHe received daily dialysis with intravenous sodium thiosulfate given post dialysis for three days. His calcium-containing phosphate binders and paricalcitol were stopped; dosage was increased for sevelamer and lanthanum carbonate, another phosphate binder, was added to lower phosphorus levels. The patient’s pain, redness, swelling and induration improved over the next three days and his calcium was 8.5 gm/dl and phosphorus 7.3 mg/dl at the time of discharge.",

She had no fever, expectoration, or chest pain.\nShe had been diagnosed with hypertension and dyslipidemia and the origin of the kidney disease was unknown. Before transplantation in 2007, she received hemodialysis for two years due to a right brachiocephalic fistula. In 2012, the brachiocephalic fistula was closed as a consequence of an aneurysm and during the last year she suffered from local pain which was treated with pregabalin and opiates, with no local complications observed. The immunosuppression drugs administered to the patient were tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. The renal function remained stable with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (normal range: 0.6–1.2 mg/dL). After transplantation, she suffered from continuous urinary tract infections that were treated with antibiotics, and after a urologic evaluation in 2012, a left kidney nephrectomy was performed because of a pyelonephritis. In March 2015, an anterior colporrhaphy and posterior perineoplasty were also performed to correct a cystocele.\nIn March 2016, at admission, blood pressure was 159/92 mmHg, temperature was 36°C, and arterial oxygen saturation was 94%. A clinical examination revealed 20 breaths per minute, wheezing and basal hypoventilation, fistula pain, and ankle swelling. The rest of the physical examination was strictly normal with no local findings in the AV-fistula area. Lab tests showed normal C-reactive protein level of 0.77 mg/dL (normal range: 0.0–1.0 mg/dL), serum creatinine of 1.38 mg/dL, and leucocytes count of 7670 (normal range: 4000–11500); PCR herpes viruses 6, 7, and 8 were negative and so were galactomannan antigen, H1N1, and influenza B virus smear. Blood and urine culture were negative as well as cytomegalovirus PCR.\nThe initial workup showed a diffuse interstitial-alveolar pattern in the chest radiography and hence a piperacillin-tazobactam and a bronchodilator treatment was initiated. The first CT revealed peripheral bilateral infiltrates and minimum pleural effusion. After completing antibiotic therapy, the patient did not improve and a bronchoscopy was performed which showed no atypical cells or signs of infection. BAL and pleural effusion were also tested and were negative for infection and showed no malignancy. A second CT revealed worsening of the infiltrates and pleural thickening which suggested neoplasia. A pulmonary biopsy by videothoracoscopy was performed. It was of an excellent quality and revealed a good representation of the pleura (parietal and visceral), pulmonary parenchyma, vascular areas, and airways.\nA first examination of the histologic sections showed a tumor characterized by atypical cells with vascular affectation that invaded the visceral pleura. There were multiple nodular neoformations with hemorrhagic areas showing a circumferential growth that affected blood vessels and bronchioles, which extended to adjacent areas and to the subpleural pulmonary interstitium. Vimentin stain, CD34, CD31, and VIII factor all resulted to be positive. The expression of herpes virus 8 was negative. These results suggested a metastatic mesenchymal tumor. Subsequently, a right arm arteriography revealed a 7 cm mass in the brachiocephalic fistula (Figures and ) and a biopsy was performed that was compatible with epitheliod angiosarcoma (). The diagnosis of an arteriovenous fistula angiosarcoma with pulmonary metastasis was carried out.",

        "Patient Note": "A 64-year-old Brazilian man was admitted to the emergency department of our institution in April 2019 claiming fatigue, malaise, intermittent fever, and weight loss. In the first physical exam he presented hypotension and mental confusion. Three months before he began with progressive prostration, unintentional weight loss of 15 kg, intermittent fever, and night sweats. He was evaluated at an external hematology clinic 2 weeks before to come at our service and was diagnosed with multiple myeloma based on laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy.\nAt initial physical examination, he had a temperature of 36.3 °C, a pulse of 81 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 incursions per minute, a peripheral oxygen saturation of 94% in ambient air, a blood pressure of 86/51 mmHg, and a slower peripheral perfusion (4 seconds). He had significant skin-mucous pallor, jaundice 2+/4+, lowered level of consciousness (Glasgow 14), mental confusion, and flapping in the upper extremities. The rest of the physical examination showed no other significant changes.\nInitial laboratory evaluation revealed: hemoglobin (Hb) 9.7 g/L, hematocrit (Ht) 28.2%, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 82.7 fl, white blood count (WBC) 3.02 × 109/L, neutrophils: 2.3 × 109/L, lymphocytes: 0.5 × 109/L, platelets: 39 × 109/L, Na++ 127 mEq/L, K+ 4.3 mEq/L, total Ca++ 9.3 mg/L, P 3.1 mg/L, creatinine 1.84 mg/dL, BUN 122 mg/dL, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 648 U/L, and C-protein reactive (CPR) 58.1 mg/L. Hepatic profile showed alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 258 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 213 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 386 U/L, gamma GT 473 U/L, total bilirubin: 2.95 mg dL (direct bilirubin [DB]: 2.29 /indirect bilirubin [IB]: 0.66), albumin 2.4 g/dL, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR): 1.27, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) ratio = 1.23. Laboratory evolution throughout hospitalization is summarized in Table .\nIn the emergency department, peripheral blood and urine cultures were collected and intravenous saline fluid and ceftriaxone was administered for treatment of supposed infectious etiologies. After initial measurements, blood pressure was normalized and the patient was stabilized. In his previous medical history, he had systemic arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure caused by recurrent nephrolithiasis. He used carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, spironolactone 25 mg once daily, ivabradine 5 mg twice daily, AAS 100 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg daily.\nThe patient had external laboratory tests showing 0.8 g/dL of monoclonal protein, IgA kappa paraprotein at serum immunofixation, serum IgA of 1038 mg/dL (70–400 mg/dL), and β2 microglobulin of 20.61 mg/L (0.8–2.2 mg/L). Bone marrow biopsy was hypercellular with monoclonal plasma cell proliferation CD56 (+), kappa light chain restriction, representing 30% of the total nucleated cells. A diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) Durie Salmon IIIA, ISS III was established in this moment.\nChest, abdomen, and pelvic computerized tomography (CT) revealed multiple lymphadenopathies up to 5.0 cm and splenomegaly. Positron emission CT with 18-fluoro deoxyglucose (18-FDG-PETCT) showed multiple lymphadenopathies in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis with SUVmax 12.0, liver FDG uptake 15.8 (SUVmax), and 16.4 cm splenomegaly with 15.8 spleen FDG uptake (Fig. ). Echocardiography was negative for endocarditis.\nThere was negativity for viral hepatitis B and C serology as well as for HIV, HTLV1, chickenpox, toxoplasmosis, herpes, cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, paraecovirus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Blood cultures were negative. As the patient persisted with fever, ceftriaxone introduced at admission was replaced by Piperacillin/Tazobactam and Teicoplanin. However, the patient evolved quickly with multiorgan dysfunction characterized by liver and renal failure, LDH increase, and coagulopathy characterized by prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen, and factor V reduction keeping factor VIII level between the normal range values (Table ).\nAs the clinician suspected of concurrent HLH further tests showed serum ferritin level of 47.502 ng/mL (30–400 ng/mL) and slight elevation of triglycerides. A new bone marrow aspiration confirmed the presence of 21.6% of aberrant plasma cells with significant macrophage activity with several haemophagocytosis pictures (Fig. ). Immunophenotyping demonstrated 4.9% of anomalous and monoclonal plasma cells expressing CD45dim, CD19partial, CD38bright, CD138bright, CD56dim, CD117dim, and kappa light chain restriction in cytoplasm. Thereafter, the patient was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit and pulse therapy with methylprednisolone 1 g/d for 3 days was administered to control HLH. Afterwards the patient received cyclophosphamide at dose of 500 mg once weekly and dexamethasone 20 mg once daily D1–D4 as anti-multiple myeloma treatment. We were not able to investigate lymphadenopathy because the patient became soon hemodynamically unstable, requiring mechanical ventilation support and renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. Unfortunately, the patient died 15 days after hospitalization.",

The coefficients A and B are dependent on the patient's gender and the patient's creatinine concentration.\nThe patient is 64 years old. The patient's gender is Male, and so the patient's gender coefficient is 1.0.\nThe concentration of Serum Creatinine is 1.84 mg/dL. Because the patient's gender is male and the creatinine concentration is greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dL, A = 0.9 and B = -1.2.\nPlugging in these values, we get 142 * (1.84/0.9)**-1.2 * 0.9938**64 * 1.0 = 40.43277.\nHence, the GFR value is 40.43277 ml/min/1.73 m².",

        "Patient Note": "A 90-year-old African American female with a history of type 2 diabetes, essential hypertension, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and atrial flutter on chronic anticoagulation with apixaban presented for new-onset general tonic-clonic seizures, witnessed by her family. The patient had been bed-bound from arthritis in a nursing home, but her mental status had been intact. The patient had recently been hospitalized over 3 weeks ago for COVID-19 pneumonia and was discharged home with home hospice one week before readmission.\nAccording to her family, the patient's mental status had severely declined during her previous hospitalization with COVID-19. She developed staring spells after discharge that culminated into generalized tonic-clonic seizures on the day of the current admission. The episode lasted two seconds. Per her hospice nurse, blood pressures and blood glucose were well controlled at home. The home medications were thoroughly reviewed and found not to have any typical pharmacologic culprits. When she presented to the emergency department, she had two more witnessed seizures. Her blood pressure during this episode was 227/95 mm Hg, her heart rate was 98 beats/min, the temperature was 36.7°C, her respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation was 93% while she breathed room air. Intravenous labetalol, lorazepam, and levetiracetam were administered. Her blood pressure decreased to 160/70 mm Hg and remained well controlled during her hospitalization. Head CT and basic laboratory work () were unremarkable. Her physical exam was notable for postictal confusion. She was alert and only oriented to person. An electroencephalogram (EEG) detected no evidence of seizure or epileptiform discharges, but generalized slowing with an intermittent focal slowing in the bilateral temporal regions was noticed (). Brain MRI demonstrated subcortical and cortical FLAIR signal abnormality involving the left greater than right parieto-occipital lobes and the left temporal lobe, in a pattern most compatible with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) (Figures –). There was no acute intracranial hemorrhage or infarction.\nThe patient had no further seizures after being treated with levetiracetam. Her mental state gradually returned to normal. She became more eager to participate in physical therapy and be more independent. She set a goal to walk without her walker and to cook for her family and friends. Her family was pleasantly surprised by this improvement in her mentation. She had no further seizure activity in the hospital and was discharged back home with home care services. She is doing well six months after discharge, is seizure-free, and follows her scheduled appointments. Follow-up MRI four months later after presentation showed complete or near resolution of the lesions (Figures –).\nNo written consent has been obtained from the patient as there is no patient identifiable data included in the case report.",

He spontaneously regained consciousness after a few seconds but was confused for ∼15–20 min. He had no recollection of the event, and was hemodynamically stable and neurologically intact. He denied illicit drug use. Vitals, physical examination and laboratory studies were within normal limits. ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with normal PR and QT intervals and no ST-T wave changes. He was on no AV blocking agents. Head CT showed no intracranial bleed or mass lesion.\nHe had a history of five similar episodes in the past. During the last episode, he had been noted to have sinus arrest on telemetry and underwent single atrial lead pacemaker placement. The pacemaker was programmed to AAI mode. AV conduction was tested and was normal. Coronary angiogram showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. EEG had been minimally abnormal with left temporal theta slowing, suggestive of an area of neurophysiologic dysfunction, but no epileptiform activity was noted. He had no history of febrile seizures, central nervous system infection or cranial trauma.\nThe patient was admitted for further work up. Continuous EEG monitoring was ordered to evaluate for seizure activity. At ∼7 min and 36 s, the patient started to have recurrent automatisms and became unresponsive, with the EEG showing complex partial seizure activity emanating from the left anterior temporal region with continued post-ictal right temporal delta slowing. The seizure lasted ∼1 min. The simultaneous ECG lead demonstrated heart rate slowing toward the end of the seizure episode, with the rhythm changing from sinus to atrially paced at 60 beats min−1 with 1:1 conduction, to atrially paced with 2:1 AV block, followed by complete heart block for 4 s, followed by resumption of the baseline atrially paced rhythm with 1:1 conduction (Fig. ).\nCardiac electrophysiology recommended treating the seizure episodes before considering upgrade of the pacemaker to a dual-chamber device. The patient was started and subsequently discharged on levetiracetam. More than 15 months later, he has had no seizures or syncopal events.",

        "Patient Note": "A 59-year-old man diagnosed with obstructive hydrocephalus was scheduled for an ETV. The patient had a medical history of well-controlled diabetes mellitus and hypertension that was being treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker, a calcium channel blocker, and a beta blocker. The body mass index was 33.8, but he had no respiratory symptoms, including sleep apnea. A preoperative chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly but electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal. The patient's symptoms were amnesia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence that had persisted for 5 months; preoperatively, he was alert and cooperative and had no problem communicating. The preoperative vital signs were: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 59 beats/min; respiratory rate, 18 breaths/min; and oxygen saturation, 96%. Since the appearance of the patient suggested a possible difficult intubation, a video laryngoscope was used for tracheal intubation after induction of general anesthesia with 150 mg propofol 1%, 40 mg lidocaine 2%, and 60 mg rocuronium. The vocal cord was clearly visible on the video laryngoscope and the intubation was accomplished without trauma or other difficulties. Anesthesia was maintained with 5% desflurane and 0.02 µg/kg/min remifentanil, and air with 50% oxygen. The surgery lasted 2 hours and required no additional muscle relaxants. During the surgery, there was sudden and sustained hypotension (mean blood pressure 52–57 mmHg) with bradycardia (heart rate 45–55 beats/min) that did not respond well to ephedrine; these complications began about 10 min after the beginning of the surgery and lasted for 25 min until a dopamine infusion was administered that restored normal blood pressure. Remifentanil infusion was discontinued at the onset of hypotension and bradycardia. After the purge of volatile agents at the end of the surgery, the train of four (TOF) count was 4, and the ratio was 50%, so 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected. The patient recovered muscle power within a few minutes, showing firm hand grip, head elevation, and mouth opening, and was fully obeying verbal commands, but was not opening his eyes. As he was alert and cooperative at that point and no other neurologic deficit was observed, the neurosurgeons thought that the inability to open his eyes was not related to the surgery. We relieved the bandage on the head in order to reduce the chance of unintended pressure or tension on the forehead, and suggested that further neurologic examinations be done after full recovery from anesthesia. Spontaneous respiration was present, showing expired tidal volumes reaching 500 ml each time, but was tachypneic; the patient's respiratory rate ranged from 40 to 50 breaths/min. This condition continued for 5 min, at which time the patient was extubated and transferred to the PACU under mask ventilation. The patient showed signs of inspiratory stridor, chest retractions, and hoarse voice after the extubation. The patient's accessory respiratory muscles were not involved in the hyperventilation. There was no crackle or wheezing clear on auscultation besides the inspiratory stridor, but the findings were not clear on account of the hoarse voice and the rapid and dynamic ventilation. An additional 2 mg/kg of sugammadex was injected in the PACU under the theory that the patient's upper airway was obstructed because of possible residual paralysis but the condition did not change. The patient was fully responsive to verbal commands but was still unable to open his eyes or hold his breath and he complained of feeling like he was choking despite the hyperventilation. Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) at that point showed: pH, 7.35; pCO2, 37 mmHg; pO2, 76 mmHg; HCO3, 20.4 mmol/L; and O2 saturation, 94%. The vital signs at that point were: blood pressure, 150/90 mmHg; heart rate, 110 beats/min; and respiratory rate, 44 breaths/min. Since tachypnea (40–50 breaths/min) persisted for 20 min in the PACU and oxygen saturation started to drop under 95%, 200 mg thiopental sodium and 100 mg succinylcholine were injected and endotracheal intubation was performed. Endotracheal suction was done immediately after intubation and there was no sputum or discharge. Auscultation right after the re-intubation sounded smooth, without crackle or wheezing, and the oxygen saturation rapidly corrected to 100%. Tachypnea persisted even under sedation after the succinylcholine wore off, so a central cause was suspected. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a massive pneumocephalus with pneumoventricle and hydrocephalus (). A chest X-ray taken after the brain CT showed no pathologic findings such as pulmonary edema, congestion, or pneumothorax. On the neurosurgeon's recommendation, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit and was kept there for three days under mechanical ventilation with sedation with midazolam, cisatracurium, and rocuronium until the pneumocephalus and tachypnea spontaneously resolved. Follow-up chest radiographs were taken over the next 3 weeks and showed nothing abnormal. According to a pulmonology consultation, the tachypnea was not likely to have originated from pulmonary problems. ABGA results stayed within normal limits under fully controlled mechanical ventilation but showed hypoxemia when the patient gained spontaneous respiration during the sedative period before the resolution of the pneumocephalus. Since the follow-up chest X-rays showed no abnormal findings, pulmonary embolism evaluation including embolism CT and laboratory examinations, which also showed nothing abnormal, were done on the recommendation of a pulmonologist. When a follow-up brain CT showed resolution of the pneumocephalus on the 3rd day after the surgery, sedative and neuromuscular blocking agents were discontinued and the mechanical ventilation mode was switched to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation.

EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units (focusing on the patient's status prior to treatment):\n   - Age: 59-year-old\n   - Sex: man (Male)\n   - Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) history: The note mentions 'mild cardiomegaly' on a preoperative chest X-ray but 'electrocardiography and echocardiogram findings were normal'. Mild cardiomegaly alone, without other evidence or diagnosis of CHF, does not equate to a history of CHF for this score. Thus, No CHF history.\n   - Hypertension history: 'Hypertension that was being treated'. Yes.\n   - Stroke, Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA), or Thromboembolism history: No mention of previous Stroke, TIA, or Thromboembolism. No.\n   - Vascular disease history: No mention of previous myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque. No.\n   - Diabetes history: 'Well-controlled diabetes mellitus'. Yes.\n4. CONVERT units to match formula requirements: No unit conversions are needed as all extracted values directly match the criteria categories.\n5.

Although diagnosed with atrial septal defect (ASD) 30 years previously, the patient elected not to undergo surgical repair. Approximately 1 year prior, he began to visit the pediatric ward of Samsung Medical Center more frequently with symptoms of palpitations and dyspnea lasting 2 to 3 days and occurring in 2- to 3-month intervals. An electrocardiogram showed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and secundum-type ASD (22.3 mm) with a left-to-right shunt was diagnosed by echocardiogram. Device closure (Amplatzer septal occlude 28 mm; AGA Medical, Golden Valley, MN, USA) was then performed; however, 1 week after the procedure, the patient continued to experience dyspnea and chest pain after 10 to 20 minutes of walking. Sustained atrial fibrillation was seen on the electrocardiogram and 24-hour Holter monitor. Cardioversion was performed following hospitalization with the opinion that the persistent atrial fibrillation was due to device closure. The patient was discharged from the hospital after cardioversion to sinus rhythm at 100 J; however, the symptoms recurred. Since it was difficult to perform radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) due to the recent device closure, the patient was referred to the thoracic surgery department for totally thoracoscopic ablation. Surgery was performed under routine procedures. Intubation was performed using a double lumen endotracheal tube. For the surgery, a 10-mm trocar was inserted in the fourth intercostal space (ICS) of the right anterior axillary line, a 5-mm trocar in the third ICS along the anterior axillary line, and a 10-mm trocar in the sixth ICS on the mid-axillary line. Right pulmonary vein ablation, right ganglionated plexi ablation, and ablation of the right half of the space between the right lower pulmonary vein and the left lower pulmonary vein were performed. Between the procedures, we conducted a high-frequency stimulation test for finding ganglionated plexi. Sutures were placed after chest tube insertion. On the left side, ports were placed in the same positions, and ablations were performed in the same order as on the right side after dividing Marshall’s ligament (). A left atrial auricle resection was then performed using an Echelon Flex 60 articulating endoscopic linear cutter (Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA). Upon confirmation of the conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit. He was then transferred to the general ward on postoperative day 1 and discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 6. During this 6-day postoperative period, the sinus rhythm was maintained continuously. Six months later, the sinus rhythm was seen on the 24-hour Holter monitor; the patient showed none of the earlier symptoms, and therefore, amiodarone and warfarin were stopped. The patient is currently being followed as an outpatient, and his sinus rhythm has been well maintained as seen on the last electrocardiogram at the 8 month follow-up.",

        "Patient Note": "A 60-year-old man presented with fever and productive cough for 2 days. He had a history of type 2 diabetes for 12 years and received peritoneal dialysis for diabetic nephropathy for 5 years. He also received antihypertensive drugs for hypertension for 10 years. There was no personal or family history of coagulopathy or stroke, trauma, chest pain, or illicit intravenous drug use.\nAdmission physical examination revealed the patient to be febrile (39.1°C), tachycardic with a pulse of 112/min, a respiratory rate of 22/min, and hypertensive with a blood pressure of 170/80 mm Hg. Bibasilar crackles were heard on auscultation. The peritoneal dialysis catheter was correctly positioned in the right lower abdomen, with no local erythema. There was no exudate buildup in catheter dressings. His systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable, with no tenderness, ecchymosis, or other external signs of trauma.\nInitial blood workup showed neutrophilic leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.8 × 109/L (normal reference: 4.0–10 × 109/L) and 82.6% neutrophils (normal reference: 50%–70%). The patient was anemic (hemoglobin 95 g/L; normal reference: 120–160 g/L), with a normal platelet count (181 × 109/L; normal reference: 100–300 × 109/L). Both his prothrombin time (PT; 12.1 s, normal reference: 10–14 s) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT; 34.1 s, normal reference: 20–40 s) were normal. Blood chemistry showed elevated blood urea nitrogen (20.5 mmol/L; normal reference: 3.2–7.1 mmol) and creatinine (1125 µmol/L; normal reference: 53–106 µmol/L). Blood glucose was 6.4 mmol/L (normal reference: 3.9–6.1 mmol/L), K+ 4.14 mmol/L (normal reference: 3.5–5.5 mmol/L), Na+ 145 mmol/L (normal reference: 135–145 mmol/L), Cl+ 108 mmol/L (normal reference: 95–105 mmol/L), and Ca++ 2.1 mmol/L (normal reference: 2.25–2.58 mmol/L). Liver function test was normal. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.40 (normal reference: 7.35–7.45), PaO2 60.1 mm Hg (normal reference: 95–100 mm Hg), PaCO2 44.8 mm Hg (normal reference: 35–45 mm Hg), and HCO3– 29.6 mmol/L (normal reference: 22–27 mmol/L). Chest X ray revealed patchy opacities in the right lower lung. The right diaphragmatic surface and costophrenic angle were also blurred. Furthermore, the cardiac silhouette was enlarged.\nTreatment for pulmonary infection with cefoperazone-sulbactam (1.5 g every 12 h) was initiated. The patient also received subcutaneous insulin (30 units/day) and oral nifedipine sustained release tablet (30 mg daily). Peritoneal dialysis continued with 2.5% low calcium peritoneal dialysate.\nAt day 3 post admission, the patient became disoriented. He was still febrile (40.3°C). SPO2 declined to 88% despite of 5 L/min oxygen via a nasal cannula. Blood gas analysis showed pH 7.30, PaO2 53.10 mm Hg, PaCO2 58.50 mm Hg, and HCO3– 29.3 mol/L. Blood chemistry revealed that blood urea nitrogen (22.7 mmol/L) and serum creatinine (1345 µmol/L) continued to rise, and his plasma glucose also increased (8.4 mmol/L). K+, Na+, Cl+, and Ca++ were within normal range. His C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was 183 mg/L (normal reference: <8 mg/L), and procalcitonin 66.06 ng/mL (normal reference: <0.5 ng/mL). The liver function, platelet count, aPTT, and PT were normal. Thromboelastogram showed normal coagulation factor reaction time (9.9 min; normal reference: 5–10), fibrinogen reaction time (1.9 min; normal reference: 1–3), α (alpha) angle (64.9°; normal reference: 53°–72°), shear stress coefficient strength (19,233 d/s; normal reference: 4500–11,000 d/s), and hyperfibrinolysis (0.0%; normal reference: <8%) with increased platelet function (79.4 mm; normal reference: 50–70).\nThe patient was diagnosed with respiratory failure (type II) and pulmonoencephalopathy, and transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) and placed on mechanical ventilation. Imipenem (0.5 g every 6 h) was added, and low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin, 3500–5500 Da, 5–10 IU/kg/h) and insulin were delivered continuously by pumps. Peritoneal dialysis was discontinued and CVVH was undertaken at 32 mL/kg/h for renal insufficiency. The patient became oriented. Arterial blood gases showed normal pH (7.43), improved PaO2 (88.6 mm Hg), normal PaCO2 (36.5 mm Hg), and HCO3– (23.5 mmol/L). However, fever persisted (39.5°C), and the patient had difficulty weaning off mechanical ventilation.\nAbdominal computed tomography (CT) at day 5 showed a hypointense shadow in the left hepatic lobe (61 mm × 56 mm) with an indistinct border (). Liver abscess was confirmed upon ultrasound-guided drainage. The culture revealed Klebsiella pneumonia that was sensitive to third-generation cephalosporin and imipenem. Imipenem (1.0 g every 8 h) and metronidazole (0.5 g every 8 h) were given, and mechanical ventilation and CVVH continued.\nAt day 12, the patient complained left back pain, which improved the next day without treatment. Platelet count (243 × 109/L) was normal, but both aPTT (67.5 s) and PT (17.3 s) were prolonged; his thromboelastogram (heparin cup) was normal. No cutaneous and mucosal bleeding was observed. The patient had no hemoptysis and his fecal occult blood test was negative. Abdominal CT scan at day 16 revealed left iliopsoas swelling, about 61.7 mm × 64.1 mm, with inhomogeneous densities, and occasional hyperintense opacities and an indistinct border (). A diagnosis of iliopsoas hematoma was made. Anticoagulation therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin was discontinued and switched to ex vivo anticoagulation with citrate. Mechanical ventilation and anti-infection therapy (imipenem 1.0 g every 8 h, metronidazole 0.5 g every 8 h) continued. No improvement was seen, and 3 days later, the patient died after his family decided to terminate therapy.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's CURB-65 score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "1",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The CURB-65 Score criteria are listed below:\n\n1. Confusion: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n2. BUN >19 mg/dL (>7 mmol/L urea): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n3. Respiratory Rate ≥30: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n4. Systolic BP <90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤60 mmHg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n5. Age ≥65: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n\nThe total CURB-65 score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n\nThe CURB-65 score is current at 0 points.\nThe patient is 60.0 years old. The patient's age is less than 65 years, and so we add 0 points to the score, keeping the current total at 0.\nBecause the patient does not have confusion, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the score at 0.\nThe concentration of BUN is 20.5 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of BUN from mmol to mg. The mass of BUN is 20.5 mmol. To convert 20.5 mmol of BUN to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 0.001, giving us 20.5 mmol BUN * 0.001 mol/mmol = 0.0205 mol BUN. To convert from mol BUN to grams, multiply by the molar mass 28.02 g/mol, which will give 0.0205 mol BUN * 28.02 g/mol = 0.57441 g BUN. To convert 0.57441 g of BUN to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.57441 g BUN * 1000.0 mg/g = 574.41 mg BUN. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 574.41 mg BUN/10.0 dL = 57.441 mg BUN/dL. The concentration value of 20.5 mmol BUN/L converts to 57.441 mg BUN/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 1.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 170 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because neither of these statements are true, 0 points are added to score, keeping the current total to 1.\nThe patient's CURB-65 score is 1.",

        "Patient Note": "A 61-year-old white woman presented in February 2013 with fatigue, decreased appetite and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 2 weeks. She denied nausea, vomiting, weight loss and jaundice. Two weeks prior to presentation, the patient was found to have elevated liver enzymes by routine blood workup (AST 151 IU/l, ALT 199 IU/l), for which atorvastatin and ezetimibe were both discontinued (although she had been taking both for a long time). She was known to have MS (as she had clumsiness and optic neuritis with white matter hyperintensities by brain MRI, at that time not on any treatment, but treated with interferon in 2000 with resulting drug-induced hepatitis which resolved after discontinuation of interferon), hypothyroidism on levothyroxine (secondary to radioactive iodine ablation for Graves disease), hyperlipidemia and asthma.\nOn physical examination, blood pressure was 113/77 mm Hg, heart rate 64 beats/min and temperature 36.3°C. She was not jaundiced and her heart and respiratory sounds were normal. Her abdomen was soft, not tender, not distended, without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and with normal bowel sounds. She was alert and oriented, the cranial nerves were grossly intact, muscle bulk, tone and power were normal, there was no sensory deficit, and coordination and gait were both unremarkable. Laboratory tests on admission revealed white blood cells 6.1 × 103/μl, hemoglobin 14 g/dl, platelets 433 × 103/μl, sodium 138 mEq/l, potassium 4.6 mEq/l, chloride 103 mEq/l, bicarbonate 29 mmol/l, BUN 11 mg/dl, creatinine 0.7 mg/dl and glucose 94 mg/dl. Liver function test showed AST 1,740 IU/l, ALT 1,497 IU/l, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 140 IU/l, total bilirubin 2.4 mg/dl (direct bilirubin 1.3) – later on it went up to 5.1 mg/dl, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGTP) 501 IU/l (normal 7–64 IU/l), total protein 8.3 g/dl and albumin 3.8 g/dl. Coagulation panel showed prothrombin time 13.6 s, international normalized ratio 1.44 and partial thromboplastin time 30.9 s. Urine drug screen was negative. The results of thyroid function testing were thyroid-stimulating hormone 10.3 mIU/ml and free thyroxine 0.8 ng/dl. She had normal alpha-fetoprotein and a negative ethanol level. Serum protein electrophoresis showed high gamma fraction of protein 2.1 g/dl. Viral hepatitis was ruled out by negative hepatitis panel including negative hepatitis C virus RNA PCR. Complete serological tests revealed positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies at 1:320 (normal titer <1:40), negative anti-mitochondrial antibodies, negative anti-nuclear antibodies, negative anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, negative anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies, negative proteinase-3 antibodies and negative liver kidney microsomal antibodies. Ultrasound of the liver was performed and showed no significant abnormality in the liver, gallbladder or pancreas. There was no sign of gallstone or pericholecystic fluid formation. Abdominal computed tomography with contrast showed only mild fatty changes of the liver.\nWhile the patient was in the hospital, ultrasound-guided liver biopsy was done; she was started on oral prednisone 60 mg daily and discharged home on that dose awaiting the liver biopsy result. Later on this confirmed our diagnosis of AIH as it showed lobular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (fig. ), Councilman bodies and spotty necrosis. Bile duct damage and bridging periportal fibrosis were present (fig. ). In March 2013, the patient had improved clinically. Her liver enzymes were checked while she was still taking 60 mg prednisone daily with the following values: AST 360 IU/l, ALT 602 IU/l, ALP 92 IU/l, GGTP 398 IU/l and total bilirubin 2.9 mg/dl. After receiving the liver biopsy result, she was prescribed oral azathioprine 50 mg daily while tapering the prednisone dose. Her liver function was periodically checked with continuous improvement. In April 2013, she was taking both 20 mg prednisone and 50 mg azathioprine daily. In June 2013, the azathioprine was stopped and she was kept on oral prednisone 10 mg daily, which later on (in September 2013) was decreased to 5 mg daily. Her liver function has been always within the normal range since July 2013 with AST 40 IU/l, ALT 35 IU/l, ALP 37 IU/l, total bilirubin 0.9 mg/dl, GGTP 60 IU/l, total protein 6.8 g/dl and albumin 3.9 g/dl.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta gap in mEq/L? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "-5.5",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 138.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 103.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 29.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 29.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 29.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 29.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 29.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 138.0 mEq/L - (103.0 mEq/L + 29.0 mEq/L) = 6.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 6.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 3.8 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 6.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.8 (in g/dL)) = 6.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 6.5 mEq/L.Plugging in 6.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 6.5 - 12 = -5.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is -5.5 mEq/L.",

The patient was a smoker, had a history of hypertension, and was taking captopril and nimodipine. Breathing was reduced in the left lung. However, neither rhonchus nor moist rales were heard during auscultation. Chest computed tomography revealed a GEB, and the left lung was compressed by about 95% with a right mediastinal shift (). An electrocardiogram showed normal findings, and echocardiography revealed that the heart was located in the right thoracic cavity. The left ventricular diastolic function was decreased, and the left ventricular ejection fraction was 64%. Laboratory tests showed no obvious abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis showed the following: pH: 7.43, PaCO2: 41 mmHg, PaO2: 94 mmHg, lactate: 1.4 mmol/L, potassium: 3.6 mmol/L, sodium: 138 mmol/L, calcium: 1.10 mmol/L, FiO2: 21%, and SpO2: 98%.\nOn the day of surgery, the patient’s electrocardiogram, blood pressure, SpO2, and bispectral index were monitored upon entry into the operating room. A radial artery catheter and right internal jugular venous catheter were placed. The patient’s arterial blood pressure was 175/109 mmHg, heart rate was 90 beats/minute, and SpO2 was 94%. Before anesthesia, 40 µg of dexmedetomidine was infused within 10 minutes. The thoracic surgeon then created a small incision at the intersection of the sixth intercostal space and the left mid-axillary line to puncture the lung bulla and insert an indwelling catheter (14 Ga, 16 cm in length; Arrow International/Teleflex, Wayne, PA, USA) into the GEB to drain it for 15 minutes. The patient was preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at 6 L/minute for 5 minutes. Anesthesia was administered using 100 mg of propofol, 30 µg of sufentanil, and 50 mg of rocuronium. A 37-Fr right double-lumen endotracheal tube was inserted with the help of a visual laryngoscope, and single-lung ventilation was performed after proper alignment had been confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The tidal volume was set at 5 to 6 mL/kg, the respiratory rate was 15 to 17 breaths/minute, the positive end-expiratory pressure was set at 5 cmH2O, and the inhalation:expiration ratio was 1:2. Propofol, remifentanil, and sevoflurane were used to maintain anesthesia. The intraoperative bispectral index was maintained at 40 to 50. After resecting the GEB (), one-lung ventilation was switched to two-lung ventilation and the lungs slowly expanded with a low tidal volume until complete lung re-expansion was observed. During the 3-hour surgery, the patient experienced 50 mL of blood loss, was administered 1300 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution, and excreted 500 mL of urine. After the operation, the double-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a single-lumen endotracheal tube and the patient was sent to the intensive care unit for monitoring and further treatment. Two hours after entering the intensive care unit, the patient was fully awake and the tracheal tube was smoothly removed. The following day, the patient was transferred to the thoracic surgery ward, where he recovered; he was discharged 12 days later. Postoperative chest computed tomography showed that the lungs were well inflated with no abnormalities ().",

He consulted at the emergency room due to epigastric pain that started five days prior and decreased urine volume noted on the day of the visit. There was no accompanying vomiting, diarrhea, or fever.\nThe patient has been on insulin for diabetes mellitus since 5 years ago and has a history of being hospitalized for chronic pancreatitis and alcoholic hepatitis one year ago. He had no previous surgeries. He denied use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker, and herbal or dietary supplements.\nThe patient had recently travelled to Japan. He worked as a chef, and upon detailed history taking, the patient claimed his diet only consisted of tomato meatball pasta and carbonara for nine consecutive days prior to his hospitalization. Each serving of meatball pasta contained 100 g shredded mozzarella cheese (656 mg phosphorus/100 g) and 1 slice of cheddar cheese (936 mg phosphorus/100 g), while each serving of carbonara included 100 g mozzarella cheese and 125 g camembert cheese (347 mg phosphorus/100 g). Pasta also has 253 mg phosphorus for every 100 g. The amount of phosphorus he consumed is estimated to be more than twice the recommended intake for adult men.\nUpon admission, vital signs were normal. Physical examination showed signs of volume overload.\nLaboratory test results showed azotemia (serum creatinine 12.85 mg/dL and urea nitrogen 85 mg/dL) and elevated potassium (6.7 mmol/L), uric acid (9.0 mg/dL) and phosphorus (3.62 mmol/L) levels. Patient was hypocalcemic at 1.65 mmol/L (corrected calcium 1.79 mmol/L). Serum magnesium (0.66 mmol/L) was normal. Parathyroid hormone was within acceptable limits for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. He also presented with uncompensated metabolic acidosis (pH 7.147, bicarbonate 11.8 mmol/L). Patient’s latest serum creatinine before hospitalization was 1.68 mg/dL three months prior (estimated glomerular filtration rate 50.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2). Due to the rapid deterioration of renal function, further work-up was requested to establish other possible causes of AKI and/or CKD progression. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA), and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) were negative. Patient had normal C3 and C4 levels (95 mg% and 26.30 mg%, respectively). Random urine protein/creatinine ratio was 1322.81 mg/g.\nOn ultrasound, the kidneys were normal-sized (right 12.1 cm and left 11.6 cm), with increased cortical echogenecity. No suspicious focal lesions or signs of urinary obstruction were noted.\nKidney biopsy under ultrasound guidance was performed (Figure ) on the fourth hospital day. The kidney biopsy revealed normal to mildly enlarged glomeruli, but with partially shrinked glomerular tufts; marked focal atrophy, tubular cell injury with some transparent crystal casts. There was also marked focal interstitial fibrosis and focal infiltration of mononuclear cells and a few eosinophils. Fibrointimal thickening of blood vessels were also noted.

        "Patient Note": "A 14-year-old adolescent boy was referred to our Endocrinology Department for evaluation of short stature. As no medical records were available, previous growth velocity could not be evaluated. The patient reported that he had always been short for his age throughout his childhood.\nHis recent medical history was negative for headaches, vomiting, or vision changes. There were no reports of fatigue, cold intolerance, constipation, and skin or hair changes. Appetite was normal with no recent weight loss. There were no academic concerns. He regularly played football, with no history of traumatic or nontraumatic fractures. He took no medications. For several months, he had reported minor bilateral symmetrical crookedness on his second fingers, without any pain or local symptoms.\nHe had been born at 36 gestational weeks, weighing 2450 g with no history of abnormal gestation, breech presentation, ischemic insult at birth, or other neonatal events.\nParental heights were normal, with a target height of 177.5 cm. Parental pubertal timing was also within normal limits. Family history was negative for short stature, endocrine, or autoimmune conditions.\nClinical examination revealed a dysmorphic, proportionate, and relatively short adolescent with normal vital signs. His anthropometric parameters were −2 SDs (standard deviations) for weight (37 kg) and between −2 SDs and −2.5 SDs for height (148 cm) (Belgian charts). His height was below his midparental genetic interval. His upper:lower segment ratio and arm span were normal. His hands and feet appeared short, with middle, painless tumefaction of soft tissue around the index proximal interphalangeal joints. No spinal abnormalities were noted, but a mild pectus excavatum was present. There was no thyromegaly. Testicular and pubic hair development was in Tanner stage II (testicular volume 6 ml). The most prominent dysmorphic features were a pear-shaped nose, a thin upper lip with small lower jaw, prominent ears, and markedly thin and sparse blonde hair with rarefaction of the lateral eyebrows (). The teeth examination was difficult because he wore dental braces to correct dental irregularities.\nAn extensive biological workup was performed. Complete blood count and serum levels of inflammatory markers, electrolytes, glucose, renal function, liver enzyme, and tissue transglutaminase antibody levels were normal. The laboratory findings showed normal thyroid and adrenal function and normal growth hormone secretion (normal levels of insulin-like growth factor and insulin-like growth factor binding protein). Additional pituitary and gonad testing revealed a normal prolactin level and pubertal testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (). The bone age was evaluated at 12 years 6 months.\nA renal and cardiac ultrasound looking for other possible somatic malformations [] wasperformed and showed normal morphological kidneys, ureters, and urinary bladder and no cardiac abnormalities.\nAfter this first clinical, biological, and radiological evaluation, the working diagnosis was constitutional growth delay with late normal puberty, but skeletal dysplasia (dysmorphic features in the context of short stature) was considered for differential diagnosis.\nDuring the follow-up 6 months later, the initial apparent soft tissue tumefaction of his indexes had progressed to localized noninflammatory and painless deformity, causing limited difficulty in writing and typing on a keyboard. This sign was isolated, and the patient did not complain of pain or history of local trauma or infection. At this time, his clinical appearance was normal, except for the aforementioned dysmorphic traits. His growth velocity (5 cm/6 months) was normal in the context of spontaneous pubertal progress (Tanner stage III, testicular volume 8–10 ml).\nClinical examination of his hands revealed isolated ulnar deviation of the second fingers and symmetrical deformity of proximal interphalangeal joints of both hands (). He had no other painful or deformed joints.\nHis feet look normal, but the toes are short ().\nTheoretically, a differential diagnosis with inflammatory arthritis was considered, but the clinical findings (dysmorphic features, short stature, and relatively asymptomatic finger abnormalities) were more suggestive of a skeletal dysplasia. Radiographs of hands, feet, and pelvis were performed and allowed the definitive diagnosis.\nThe plain radiograph of his wrists showed cone-shaped epiphyses of the middle phalanges of the second digit of both hands with moderate deviation of the phalangeal axis (Figures and ).\nSimilar cone-shaped epiphyses were found in the proximal phalanx of the great toe and up to the fourth one of both feet with shortness of all toes ().\nNo other radiological joint impairments (juxtaarticular osteopenia or erosions) were found. Radiographs of the pelvis and whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (looking for fine abnormalities, particularly long bone cysts not visible on plain radiographs) [] were normal. The bone age was retarded at 12 years 6 months (the chronological age was 14 years 6 months).\nTaking together the clinical and particularly the radiological findings, the correct diagnosis of trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS) was achieved. This was a delayed diagnosis, and our explanations for this include the underrecognition of the dysmorphic features (in our first examination), the underinterpretation of fingers tumefaction in the clinical context, and consecutively no hand radiological exam being conducted.\nOther entities associating ectodermal and skeletal phenotypes were reviewed, particularly Albright osteodystrophy, acrodysostosis, and other brachydactyly syndromes, but several features of the presentation were inconsistent with these diagnoses.\nCytogenetic analysis was not performed. The family history appeared to be negative, his parents and his sister do not manifest the syndrome phenotype, and in such conditions, a sporadic case of TRPS type I was considered highly possible.",

The patient had advanced gonarthrosis of the left knee, advanced degeneration of the cervical spine and advanced bilateral omarthrosis. His medical history included kidney stone surgery (1988), diagnosis of ochronosis based on a biopsy of the knee joint (1995), total hip replacement (1997), Miller-Galante II prosthesis of the right knee (1997), periosteal rupture of the left Achilles tendon with transosseous re-fixation (1999), ventral corporectomy at C4 and discectomy at C3/C4 and C4/C5 after cervical spinal canal stenosis with myelopathy at C3-C5, and ventral and dorsal osteochondrosis (2001). Family history revealed that his brother also had ochronosis. The patient was not on any medication.\nOn physical examination, the patient was found to be in a moderately reduced general condition and in a regular nutritional status. His body mass index was 25.8 kg/m2. He had a blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg bilaterally and a pulse rate of 80 beats/min. Dyspnoea, cyanosis and liver skin spots were not observed. Bluish-black pigmentations were found on several parts of the sclera (Figure ). The patient's pupils were of average width and showed prompt response to light. No arcus lipoides, no goitre and no superior vena cava syndrome were noticed. His thorax and chest expansion were symmetrical. Breath sounds were vesicular and percussion resonant, with no crepitations or evidence of a pleural effusion. His heart beat was regular with a grade 2/6 diastolic murmur at the apex and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur over the mitral and tricuspid valves. His abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation, liver and spleen were not enlarged, and there was no costo-vertebral-angular tenderness. Unilateral oedema on the left ankle was observed. Also, the left foot pulse was absent, while normal central and peripheral pulses were symmetrically palpable.\nResults of the patient's laboratory examination showed 252 mg/dl total cholesterol, 84 mg/dl triglycerides, and 66 mg/dl high-density lipoprotein. Inflammatory markers were not elevated and anti-streptolysin O (ASO) titre was not raised. The patient's urine turned brownish black when left standing for some time.\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) test showed a sinus rhythm of 72 beats/min with left axis deviation (-57 degrees). The patient's depolarisation and repolarisation phases were normal. During an exercise ECG using a treadmill set up to 125 watts workload, his blood pressure increased from 160/90 mmHg to 160/100 mmHg and his pulse rate from 68 to 158 beats/min. When the exercise ECG was stopped at the point of exhaustion, no angina pectoris, dyspnoea, significant ST segment depression or profound dysrhythmia were observed. His blood pressure and pulse rate normalised within 3 minutes of recovery.\nAn echocardiogram revealed that the patient's left atrium was normal in size while his left ventricle was slightly dilated (Figure ). The pumping function of the left heart was normal - there was no evidence of hypertrophy - and the aortic valve had three cusps. A Doppler echocardiogram showed a minor to moderate aortic insufficiency, a combined mitral valve defect with an opening size of 1.6 cm2 with mild to moderate regurgitation, and a mild tricuspid regurgitation. No pericardial effusion was detected. The patient's right heart was normal in size without any signs of stasis.\nA histopathological analysis of the patient revealed brownish deposits between the collagen fibre bundles of a knee joint biopsy sample. The pigment was found both extracellularly and intracellularly. The appearance of the pigment was variable, being coarse, like haemosiderin and fine, like granules. Iron staining was negative and no inflammatory or post-inflammatory changes were observed. Taken together, the patient's histopathology was characteristic for ochronosis.\nBased on cardiac investigations, an alkaptonuria-associated degenerative valve defect with aortic, mitral and tricuspid valve insufficiency was diagnosed. The decision for using conservative therapy was reached and the patient was treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (2.5 mg/day ramipril).\nAt follow-up examinations in April and November 2008, the patient presented in a stable condition. However, in February 2009, the patient was hospitalised because of cardiac decompensation.=",

        "Patient Note": "A 56-year-old man was transferred to nephrology department due to recurrent episodes of fever (38°C～39.2°C), cough, sputum, and thoracalgia for the past three months. The patient had been admitted previously to a local hospital where computer tomography (CT) revealed pleural effusion in both lungs. Laboratory tests showed serum creatinine (sCr) 221.9 μmol/L; proteinuria (3+); and 24 hour proteinuria 5.3g. The patient was diagnosed with chronic renal insufficiency, and pulmonary infection. He was treated with antibiotics for pulmonary infection, but infection-related symptoms gradually worsened and serum creatinine levels reached 434μmol/L within one week. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to our unit for further treatment.\nOn admission, physical examination showed T 38°C; R, 18 bpm; HR, 99 bpm; and BP 124/60 mmHg. Laboratory tests found hemoglobin (Hb) 81 g/L; WBC 18.27x109/L, ESR 49.0 mm/H, and sCr 611.0 μmol/L; Urea 22.90 mmol/L; antinuclear antibody (ANA) (−); extractable nucler antigen (ENA) (−); C-reactive protein (CRP) 231mg/L; IgG 10.1g/L; IgA 1650.0 mg/L; IgM 345.0 mg/L; IgE 227.95 IU/mL; RBC 30~40/HPF in the \n; and 24 hour proteinuria 2.9 g/L. Ultrasound examination of the urologic system showed enlarged kidneys. Additional laboratory tests found P-ANCA (1:10) (+); ANCA-MPO (+); anti-GBM antibody (−). The patient was diagnosed with ANCA-associated vasculitis, AAV associated glomerulonephritis and put on CVVH and antibiotic therapy. After one week, the patient’s infection-related symptoms gradually improved, and the patient was put on intravenous methylprednisolone therapy (80 mg/d).\nFour days later, however, the patient developed melana mixed with bloody stool. Laboratory tests revealed Hb 87g/L, Cr 586.9 umol/L, PLT 355×109/L, Fib 2.48 g/L, PT 17.8s, Antithrombin III 92.2%. The gastroscopy and colonoscopy were normal. And capsule endoscopy revealed no obvious abnormalities, including bleeding of mucous membrane. Conventional therapy of GI bleeding (PPI and somatostatin) was ineffective. Finally selective mesenteric arterial angiography was performed, which indicated a hemorrhagic spot in a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery (). Selective transarterial embolization was performed with steel coils (Cook, Bloomington, USA.) (). After the procedure, GI bleeding was completely alleviated. However, two weeks later, the patient presented with hematochezia again and selective transarterial angiography was performed repeatedly, which revealed another hemorrhagic spot in a branch of IMA, and subsequently arterial embolization with coils was performed again (, ).\nAfter TAE, the symptoms improved and three days later, the repeated fecal-occult-blood tests were negative, but the vasculitis was not completely controlled for the other symptoms were still existed. The patient was treated with a course of intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy (500 mg/d) followed by a course of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CTX) pulse therapy (600mg). Moreover, the patient underwent repeated plasma exchange (8 sections), blood products transfusion, cryoprecipitate therapy, and intravenous gamma globulin infusion (20 g/d for 5 days).",
        "Question": "What is the patient's score of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "1",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The criteria for the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) are listed below:\n\n1. Elevated-risk surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n2. History of ischemic heart disease (history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, use of nitrate therapy, or ECG with pathological Q waves): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n3. History of congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest x-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n4. History of cerebrovascular disease (prior transient ischemic attack or stroke): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n5. Pre-operative treatment with insulin: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n6. Pre-operative creatinine >2 mg/dL (176.8 μmol/L): No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n\nThe total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n\nThe current cardiac risk index is 0.\nThe patient note does not mention anything about an elevated risk surgery and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.\nThe patient note does not mention anything about a history of ischemetic heart disease and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.\nBased on the patient note, a history of congestive heart failure is determined to be absent for the patient. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.\nThe patient note does not mention anything about a history of cerebrovascular disease and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.\nThe patient note does not mention anything about a pre-operative insulin treatment and is assumed to be absent. This means that the total score remains unchanged at 0.\nThe concentration of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 611.0 µmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mg/dL. Let's first convert the mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine from µmol to mg. The mass of Pre-Operative Creatinine is 611.0 µmol. To convert 611.0 µmol of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mol, multiply by the conversion factor 1e-06, giving us 611.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1e-06 mol/µmol = 0.00061 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert from mol Pre-Operative Creatinine to grams, multiply by the molar mass 113.12 g/mol, which will give 0.00061 mol Pre-Operative Creatinine * 113.12 g/mol = 0.069 g Pre-Operative Creatinine. To convert 0.069 g of Pre-Operative Creatinine to mg, multiply by the conversion factor 1000.0, giving us 0.069 g Pre-Operative Creatinine * 1000.0 mg/g = 69.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of mg/dL. This will result to 69.0 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/10.0 dL = 6.9 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The concentration value of 611.0 µmol Pre-Operative Creatinine/L converts to 6.9 mg Pre-Operative Creatinine/dL. The patient's pre-operative creatinine is greater than 2 mg/dL, so we increment the score by one and the current total will be 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nThe cardiac risk index score is 1.",

EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units (focusing on admission values for pre-operative assessment):\n   - Elevated-risk surgery: The patient note describes multiple procedures (CT scans, antibiotic treatment, CVVH, methylprednisolone therapy, GI bleeding, gastroscopy, colonoscopy, capsule endoscopy, selective mesenteric arterial angiography, selective transarterial embolization, plasma exchange, blood products transfusion, cryoprecipitate therapy, intravenous gamma globulin infusion, cyclophosphamide therapy). However, the critical point is whether an 'Elevated-risk surgery' is *planned* or *being assessed for*. The question asks for the RCRI for Pre-Operative Risk. The patient eventually underwent selective transarterial embolization (TAE), which is an invasive procedure. Vascular surgery (suprainguinal vascular) is listed as elevated-risk surgery. While TAE is not explicitly 'suprainguinal vascular', it is an invasive vascular procedure. Given the context of a patient undergoing multiple complex interventions, we should consider the embolization procedure for this criterion. However, the note doesn't explicitly state 'elevated-risk surgery' is planned *at the time of admission for RCRI calculation*. The task specifies 'when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment'. At that point, the procedures like TAE were not yet planned. Therefore, based strictly on the admission status *before treatment and before any procedures were decided upon*, we cannot definitively assign 'Yes' to elevated-risk surgery. We will assume 'No' for this specific RCRI calculation based on the 'first admitted...prior to any treatment' instruction.\n   - History of ischemic heart disease: Not mentioned in the patient note.\n   - History of congestive heart failure: Not mentioned in the patient note.\n   - History of cerebrovascular disease: Not mentioned in the patient note.\n   - Pre-operative treatment with insulin: Not mentioned in the patient note.\n   - Pre-operative creatinine: On admission, serum creatinine (sCr) = 611.0 μmol/L.\n4. CONVERT units to match formula requirements:\n   - Creatinine: 611.0 μmol/L. Formula requires comparison to 2 mg/dL (176.8 μmol/L).\n5. CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:\n   - Elevated-risk surgery: No = 0 points. (Based on 'first admitted...prior to any treatment' interpretation).\n   - History of ischemic heart disease: No information = 0 points.\n   - History of congestive heart failure: No information = 0 points.\n   - History of cerebrovascular disease: No information = 0 points.\n   - Pre-operative treatment with insulin: No information = 0 points.\n   - Pre-operative creatinine >2 mg/dL (176.8 μmol/L):\n     - Patient's creatinine = 611.0 μmol/L.\n     - Threshold = 176.8 μmol/L.\n     - 611.0 μmol/L > 176.8 μmol/L is true.

The patient has a history of decompensated hepatic cirrhosis that started 1 year ago complicated by ascites and a large umbilical hernia. The patient has had multiple paracentesis and had several episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. His medication list included tramadol and propranolol. Upon admission to the emergency department, he was found to be severely malnourished with significant loss of muscle mass, abdominal distention, and the presence of a large, tender, compressible umbilical hernia. Physical exam showed flank dullness, a fluid wave, and shifting dullness. Vital signs were normal, and he did not show signs of asterixis, hepatic encephalopathy, edema, or fluid overload elsewhere. His white blood cell (WBC) count was high at 10,270/µL and hemoglobin of 10.7 g/dL, hematocrit of 32.6%, and a platelet count of 130,000/µL. Further testing showed hyponatremia at 133 mmol/L and a total bilirubin of 1.9 mg/dL. Liver function test revealed an albumin of 2.9 g/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 149 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 64 U/L and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 36 U/L. X-ray confirmed large-volume ascites and the presence of a ventral hernia. Abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhotic liver morphology with large-volume ascites and splenomegaly. Ascitic fluid was yellow, and analysis showed WBC count of 70/µL, but was otherwise unremarkable. After being admitted to the hospital, patient was given furosemide 40 mg tablet daily and spironolactone 100 mg tablet daily. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management. Surgical consultation was sought, and since the patient was a very high-risk surgical candidate with loss of muscle mass, surgical intervention was not planned. The patient chose supportive care and prophylactic antibiotics based on infectious disease recommendations. An ostomy pouch was placed over the hernia to prevent bacterial contamination and peritonitis as well as to collect the ascitic fluid. The patient’s severe abdominal pain subsided and was discharged to follow up with his primary care physician.\nThree months after the patient was discharged, he came back to the hospital with worsening symptoms because he could not afford the ostomy pouches. He was not compliant with his follow-ups. His umbilical hernia appeared to have worsened, and ascitic fluid was leaking out from multiple areas on his hernia, and there were also multiple areas of skin necrosis. Since the patient was deemed a high-risk surgical candidate, he was, again, not cleared for surgery. The patient opted for conservative care and prophylactic antibiotics according to infectious disease suggestions. After symptoms improved, he was instructed on being more compliant and then subsequently discharged.",

To convert 130000.0 count/µL of platelets to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 µL/L which will give 130000.0 platelets count/µL * 1000000.0 µL/L = 130000000000.0 platelets count/L. This means that there are 130000000000.0/(10^9) = 130.0 billion platelet counts per liter.\nPlugging these values into the formula, we get (39 * 64.0)/(130.0 * sqrt(36.0)) = 3.2.Hence, the Fibrosis-4 score is 3.2.",

        "Patient Note": "A 68-year-old male with a significant past medical history of severe organ failure presents to the emergency department with acute symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and oliguria over the past 48 hours. He reports a gradual worsening of his condition, noting that he has also experienced episodes of confusion and general weakness. His past medical history includes chronic kidney disease which was treated in the emergency department, and he had been undergoing regular dialysis for the past two years. Upon arrival, the patient's vital signs were recorded. His temperature was 37.2 degrees Celsius. Cardiovascular assessment revealed a heart rate of 125 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 110/60 mm Hg. The patient appeared tachypneic with a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute. He required supplemental oxygen, receiving 51% FiO2. His partial pressure of oxygen was 72 mm Hg. Physical examination showed a moderately ill-appearing male in obvious distress, with signs of fluid overload evidenced by bilateral pitting edema and jugular venous distention. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally. Arterial blood gas analysis demonstrated a pH of 7.25, an A-a gradient of 357, and showed mild respiratory acidosis. Laboratory investigations indicated a serum sodium of 133 mEq/L and potassium of 4.9 mEq/L. Renal function tests revealed elevated creatinine at 2.2 mg/dL, consistent with his known diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, which has now progressed to acute kidney injury. Hematological studies showed a hematocrit of 34% and a significantly elevated white blood cell count of 16,000/mm^3, suggesting an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process. Neurological evaluation revealed a Glasgow Coma Score of 11, indicating a decrease in mental status with intermittent confusion. Given his history and clinical presentation, further diagnostic workup and intensive monitoring were immediately initiated. An EKG showed sinus tachycardia, but no acute ischemic changes. A chest radiograph displayed findings consistent with pulmonary congestion and possible infiltrates suggesting superimposed pneumonia. The decision was made for emergent dialysis due to his acutely deteriorating renal function and severe fluid overload. Blood cultures were drawn, along with other sepsis workups, given the high white cell count and fever indicative of a potential infectious process. This patient's complex medical history, combined with the acute onset of symptoms, necessitates a comprehensive and aggressive approach to management, involving not only the treatment of his acute renal failure but also addressing the possibility of an underlying severe infection. Close multi-disciplinary management by nephrology, intensive care, and infectious disease teams is crucial in stabilizing his condition and preventing further deterioration.",

Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 1-15 points (use 15 - [GCS Score])\n\nThe total APACHE II score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n    \nThe patient's current APACHE II score is 0 points.\nThe patient is 68 years old. Because the patient's age is between 65 and 74, 5 points are added to the total, making the current total, 0 + 5 = 5.\nThe patient note does not report any history on immunocompromise and so we assume this to be false. Hence, 0 points are added to the total, keeping the total at 5 points.\nThe patient's FiO2 percentage is 51%.\nBecause the patent's FiO2 percentrage is greater than 50%, we need to examine the A-a-gradient to compute the APACHE II score. The patient's A-a-gradient is 357. Because the patient's A-a gradient is between 350 and 500, we add 3 points to the total, making the current total 5 + 3 = 8.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.2 degrees celsius. \nBecause the patient's temperature is between 36 and 38.5 degrees celsius, no points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 8.\nThe mean average pressure is computed by the formula 1/3 * (systolic blood pressure) + 2/3 * (diastolic blood pressure). Plugging in the values, we get 1/3 * 110 mm Hg + 2/3 * 60 mm Hg = 76.66667 mm Hg.\nHence, the patient's mean arterial pressure is 76.66667 mm Hg.Because the patient's mean arterial pressure is between 70 and 109 mmHg, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 8.\nThe patient's heart rate is 125 beats per minute.\nBecause the patient's heart rate is between 110 and 139 beats per minute, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total, 8 + 2 = 10.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 30 breaths per minute.\nBecause the patient's respiratory rate is between 25 and 34 breaths per minute, 1 point is added to the score, making the current total, 10 + 1 = 11.\nThe patient's pH is 7.25.\nBecause the patient's pH is between 7.25 and 7.32, 2 points are added to the score, making the current total 11 + 2 = 13.\nThe concentration of sodium is 133 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133 mEq. To convert from 133 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L. Because the patient's sodium level is between 130 and 149 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.\nThe concentration of potassium is 4.9 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of potassium from mEq to mmol. The mass of potassium is 4.9 mEq. To convert from 4.9 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 4.9 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 4.9 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 4.9 mmol potassium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 4.9 mEq potassium/L converts to 4.9 mmol potassium/L. Because the patient's potassium level is between 3.5 and 5.4 mmol/L, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 13.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 2.2 mg/dL. The patient is determined to have an acute renal failure.\nThe patient is determined to have a chronic renal failure.\nBecause the patient has acute renal failure and a creatinine level between 2.0 and 3.5, 6 points are added to the score, making the current total 13 + 6 = 19.\nThe patient has a hematocrit of 34%.\nBecause the patient's hematocrit is between 30% and 45%, 0 points are added to the patient's score, keeping the total at 19.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell count is 16000 count/mm^3. To convert 16000 count/mm^3 of white blood cell count to L, multiply by the conversion factor 1000000.0 mm^3/L which will give 16000 white blood cell count count/mm^3 * 1000000.0 mm^3/L = 16000000000.0 white blood cell count count/L. Because the patient's white blood cell count is at least 15x10^9/L, but less than 20 x10^9/L, 1 points is added to the score, making the current total 19 + 1 = 20.\nThe patient's Glasgow Coma Score is 11. For this criterion, we subtract 15 from the 11 points and add that to the total score. 15 - 11 = 4. Hence, we add 4 to the total making the current total 4 + 20 = 24.\nHence, the patient's APACHE II score is 24.",

The criteria asks for 'Presentation with syncope', which 'dizziness' often implies in the context of bleeding. However, to be precise, the note states 'dizziness' and not 'syncope'. Without a direct mention of 'syncope' or 'fainting/passing out', I will assume 'No' for syncope according to strict interpretation, as dizziness is not explicitly syncope. Re-evaluating the common interpretation of Glasgow-Blatchford Score, 'dizziness' in the context of hypotension and low hemoglobin IS often counted as a proxy for syncope or near-syncope if no other cause is given, especially in a severe bleeding context. Given 'generalized fatigue, and dizziness' and BP of 80/60 mmHg, it's highly suggestive of presyncope/syncope. For this medical context, 'dizziness' with a BP of 80/60 mmHg and Hgb 5.8 g/dL would usually be interpreted as 'Yes' for syncope/presyncope. I will proceed with 'Yes' for syncope, as 'dizziness' is a common manifestation of presyncope associated with significant blood loss and hypotension.\n   - Liver disease history: Not mentioned in the history, so 'No'.\n   - Cardiac failure present: Not mentioned in the history, so 'No'.\n4.

White blood cell count (WBC) >12,000/mm³, <4,000/mm³, or >10% bands: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n\nThe total number of criteria met is taken by summing the score for each criteria.\n    \nThe current count of SIRS criteria met is 0.\nThe patient's temperature is 99.0 degrees fahrenheit. To convert to degrees celsius, apply the formula 5/9 * [temperature (degrees fahrenheit) - 32]. This means that the patient's temperature is 5/9 * 67.0 = 37.22222 degrees celsius. Because the temperature is between 36 and 38 degrees celsius, this does not meet SIRS criteria for temperature, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's heart rate is 70.0 beats per minute. Because the heart rate is less than 90 beats per minute, this does not meet SIRS criteria for heart rate, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe patient's concentration of white blood cell is 7000.0 count/µL. To convert 7000.0 count/µL of white blood cell to mm^3, multiply by the conversion factor 1.0 µL/mm^3 which will give 7000.0 white blood cell count/µL * 1.0 µL/mm^3 = 7000.0 white blood cell count/mm^3. Because the white blood cell count is between 4000 and 12000 count per mm^3, this does not meet SIRS criteria for white blood cell count, and so the current total remains at 0.\nThe final SIRS criteria is whether the patient has a respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or if the patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is less than 32 mm Hg. The patient's respiratory rate is 16.0 breaths per minute, which is less or equal to than 20 breaths per min. The patient's PaCO₂ partial pressure is not provided and so we assume that the patient's partial pressure is greater than or equal to 32 mm Hg. Neither criteria met and so keep the current total at 0.\nHence, the the number of SIRS criteria met by the patient is 0.",

        "Patient Note": "A 55-year-old man was first evaluated in a nephrology unit because of hypertension associated with progressive kidney failure and proteinuria. At that time, the patient presented a history of hypertension since the age of 42, hypoacusia, a superficial venous thrombosis event, and incidental evidence of cerebral ischemia.\nBlood and urine tests revealed a IIIb CKD stage renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 1.92 mg/dL, MDRD GFR 39 mL/min/1.73 mq) with mild proteinuria (0.821 g/24 h). Urine sediment was clear. A kidney biopsy was performed to explore renal disease etiology, showing non-specific advanced chronic lesions (global glomerulosclerosis in 70% of glomeruli and segmental glomerulosclerosis in 10% of glomeruli, moderate interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy, and severe arteriolosclerosis). Therapy with ACE-inhibitor was hence started.\nTwo years later, at the age of 57, a significant concentric LVH (basal septum region 18 mm) was detected during an echocardiographic evaluation for hypertension.\nRenal follow-up showed a progressive decline in renal function reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) at the patient’s age of 61. Chronic peritoneal dialysis was started, and one year later, he underwent renal transplantation from a deceased donor without complications.\nWhen the patient was 63 years old, he began complaining of dyspnea during intense exercise. Echocardiography showed worsening LVH (maximum wall thickness of 24 mm) associated with pronounced tissue hyperechogenicity and right ventricular hypertrophy, finally raising the suspicion of Fabry disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of reduced α-galactosidase A activity measured on dried blood spots (DBS) (0.5 µmol/L/h (reference values > 2.8)) and with molecular analysis revealing the N215S GLA mutation. Increased levels of lysoGb3 on DBS (6.4 ng/mL (reference values 0.0–3.5)) were detected. At diagnosis, serum creatinine was 1.23 mg/dL, and proteinuria was 0.3 g/24 h.\nThus, in March 2019, the patient was referred to our Rare Disease Center for Fabry disease management and follow-up. The Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) was 40/76 (General score—3; Neurological score—3; Cardiovascular score—16; and Renal score—18), and the total assessment Fabry Disease Severity Scoring System (DS3) was 46/80 (Peripheral Nervous System domain—0; Renal domain—23; Cardiac domain—18; Central Nervous System domain—1; and Patient-Reported domain 4).\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) showed severe biventricular hypertrophy with reduced native T1 values, suggesting myocardial glycosphingolipid storage. The left ventricular mass index was 198.4 g/m2. Extensive late gadolinium enhancement was also detected in the infero-lateral wall, with an increased T2 value indicating myocardial edema ().\nAn initial 24-h Holter monitoring revealed two runs of atrial fibrillation, which required the introduction of anticoagulant therapy.\nOne year later, in 2020, two runs of monomorphic non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were detected during a further 24-h Holter monitoring. Thus, an ICD was implanted.\nTherapy with agalsidase beta at a standard dose of 1 mg/kg every two weeks, administered at our center, was initiated in June 2019. In March 2020, the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic dramatically affected the Northern regions of Italy. Thus, the patient asked to switch to oral therapy to avoid hospital access or contact with health care workers in the case of home treatment activation. No contraindications to chaperone therapy were found (serum creatinine 1.28 mg/dL, MDRD GFR 60 mL/min/1.73 mq). We thereby started migalastat at a standard dose of 123 mg orally every other day. The patient did not show any side effects of migalastat such as headache, runny or stuffy nose, urinary tract infection, nausea, or fever. After one year of migalastat treatment, the patient was stable in terms of symptoms, renal function (serum creatinine 1.30 mg/dL, proteinuria 0.275 g/24 h), and cardiac function (CMR in March 2021 showed substantially stable cardiac features). No adjustments in the immunosuppressor dosage, namely prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus, were required. In addition, we detected a reduction in lysoGb3 levels (4.3 ng/mL; a reduction of 33% from the patient’s basal values) and an increase in α-galactosidase A activity measured on dried blood spots (1.1 µmol/L/h; an increase of 120% compared to the patient’s basal values).\nTo confirm the kidney disease etiology, we recently analyzed the residual material from the native kidney biopsy by electron microscopy, finding abundant electron-lucent microvacuoles in many cell types and multivacuolized appearance of podocytes ().",

According to her husband, she collapsed suddenly while cooking and has been unresponsive for about 20 minutes. Her medical history includes hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and a previous transient ischemic attack (TIA) two years ago. On initial evaluation, the patient’s eyes were spontaneously open. She seemed confused and was uttering inappropriate words, frequently repeating nonsensical phrases and not making coherent sentences. She did not respond to questions about her name, date, or location, indicating significant cognitive impairment or confusion. A sternal rub was performed to assess her motor response, and she displayed withdrawal from the painful stimulus by pulling away her arm briskly, suggesting she could perceive pain but had limited purposeful movement. Vital signs at the time of examination revealed a blood pressure of 180/95 mmHg, a heart rate of 98 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. Her temperature was recorded as 37.6°C (99.7°F), and oxygen saturation was 95% on room air. A thorough physical examination showed that her pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light with no apparent anisocoria. Bilateral breath sounds were clear upon auscultation, and cardiac examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs. Her abdomen was soft, non-distended, and non-tender. Given her altered mental status and prior history of TIA, a complete neurological assessment was conducted, but it was limited due to her confusion. There were no overt signs of trauma, and no external injuries were observed. Her cranial nerve exam was incomplete due to her inability to cooperate sufficiently. Motor exam revealed normal power in all four limbs but delayed response to commands. Blood tests were ordered, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, renal and liver function tests, and a blood glucose level, given her history of diabetes. A toxicology screen was also requested to rule out any possible substance ingestion. Given her presentation, an urgent non-contrast CT scan of the head was performed to exclude significant intracranial pathology such as hemorrhage, stroke, or mass lesion. Continuous monitoring and supportive care were initiated in the emergency department, with a focus on maintaining airway patency, adequate oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability. Communication was maintained with her husband, updating him on her status and the necessity of further diagnostic evaluations. The priority was to rapidly determine the cause of her acute change in mental status and guide subsequent management accordingly.",

Therefore, the formula '60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms)' is appropriate for this case.\n2. **LIST all variables and coefficients from the formula:**\n   - Formula for weight > 20 kg: 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (weight (in kilograms) - 20 kilograms)\n   - Coefficients: 60 mL/hr, 1 mL/kg/hr, 20 kilograms\n   - Variable: weight (in kilograms)\n3. **EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units:**\n   - Patient's weight: 56 kg\n4. **CONVERT units to match formula requirements:**\n   - The patient's weight is already in kilograms (56 kg), which matches the formula's requirement. No unit conversion is needed.\n5. **CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:**\n   - Maintenance fluid = 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (56 kg - 20 kg)\n   - Maintenance fluid = 60 mL/hr + 1 mL/kg/hr * (36 kg)\n   - Maintenance fluid = 60 mL/hr + 36 mL/hr\n   - Maintenance fluid = 96 mL/hr\n6. **APPLY all modifiers as specified in the formula:** There are no additional modifiers specified in the formula beyond the weight categories already applied.\n7. **VERIFY your calculation is correct before giving the final answer:** The calculation follows the formula precisely. 56 kg is greater than 20 kg. Subtracting 20 from 56 gives 36. Multiplying by 1 gives 36. Adding 60 gives 96. The steps are arithmetically correct.\n8. **ROUND only at the final step to appropriate precision:** The result is a whole number (96 mL/hr), so no further rounding is needed.",

        "Patient Note": "A 70-year-old Caucasian male initially presented to the emergency department (ED) of our hospital with fever and chills, which began one hour prior to his presentation. He also reported nausea and a productive cough with greenish sputum. The patient had been previously admitted to our hospital for pneumonia a month prior to his presentation and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility for three weeks. His past medical history was significant for end stage renal disease (ESRD) with dialysis dependence, failed kidney transplant, coronary artery disease (CAD) status with four drug-eluting stents (DES), type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic pneumonia, and hypertension.\nOn admission, his vital signs were as follow: temperature 39.4°C, blood pressure 87/55 mm Hg, pulse 100 beats per minute (bpm), oxygen saturation 88% on room air and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed coarse breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation, a left upper arm arteriovenous fistula as well as multiple superficial abrasions bilaterally on his lower extremities. His laboratory findings were as follows: white blood cells 15.12 K/µL, platelets 104 K/µL, sodium 134 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen 39 mg/dl, creatinine 4.5 mg/dl, lactic acid 2.77 mmol/L and procalcitonin 25.24 ng/ml. Urine analysis was not performed because the patient was anuric. His chest X-ray showed evidence of small effusions and bibasilar airspace disease which were indicative of atelectasis or infection. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm, a rate of 99 bpm, normal axis and no significant ST abnormalities, with paroxysmal ventricular contractions (PVCs). Blood cultures were drawn, and the patient received ceftriaxone and piperacillin/tazobactam empiric antibiotics and intravenous (IV) fluids. Gram stain of the blood specimen showed gram-negative rods.\nHe was initially admitted to the progressive care unit (PCU) with cardiac telemetry. He was found to have second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and was subsequently transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for closer management. On the second day of admission, blood cultures grew Pasteurella multocida. The organism was sensitive to beta-lactams including ampicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and ampicillin/sulbactam. The patient was treated with IV cefepime due to his comorbidities. At this time, the patient was further questioned about recent animal contact. He stated that he lived with his wife and 14 cats and admitted the cats usually scratched him when they laid on him. His subsequent hospital stay was unremarkable. He was discharged home six days after admission with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid for two weeks. The patient returned to the outpatient clinic two weeks after discharge and had made an uneventful recovery.",

Respiratory Rate ≥30: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n4. Systolic BP <90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤60 mmHg: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n5. Age ≥65: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n\nThe total CURB-65 score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n\nThe CURB-65 score is current at 0 points.\nThe patient is 70 years old. The patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, and so we add 1 point to the score, making the current total 0 + 1 = 1.\nWhether the patient has confusion is not reported in the note. Hence, we assume this to be false, and so 0 points are added to the score, making the current total 1.\nThe concentration of BUN is 39.0 mg/dL. The patient's BUN concentration is greater than 19 mg/dL and so we add 1 point to score making the current total 1 + 1 = 2.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute. Because the respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute, 0 points are added to the score, keeping the current total at 2.\nThe patient's systiolic blood pressure is 87 mm Hg. The patient's diastolic blood pressure is 55 mm Hg. For a point a point to be added, the systiolic blood pressure must be less than 90 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure must be less than or equal to 60 mm Hg. Because at least one of these statements is true, 1 point is added to score, making the current total 2 + 1 = 3.\nThe patient's CURB-65 score is 3.",

        "Patient Note": "A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a five-day history of worsening shortness of breath, productive cough with greenish sputum, pleuritic chest pain on the left side, and generalized fatigue. He reported feeling feverish but did not measure his temperature at home. He has a history of diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure, the latter being medically managed. He has no known history of renal disease, cerebrovascular events, or liver disease. On initial assessment, the patient was hemodynamically stable but mildly tachycardic with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute, a systolic blood pressure of 116 mm Hg, and a temperature of 37.0 degrees Celsius. His respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and he appeared to be in mild respiratory distress. Pulmonary examination was notable for decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the left lower lung fields, which suggested the presence of pleural effusion. On cardiovascular evaluation, his heart sounds were normal without new murmurs or gallops, though mild bilateral lower extremity edema was present. There were no signs of hepatosplenomegaly on abdominal examination. Routine blood work indicated a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 21 mg/dL, a serum sodium level of 136 mEq/L, and a serum glucose level of 180 mg/dL. His hematocrit was measured at 38%. Arterial blood gas analysis on room air showed a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 77 mm Hg and a pH of 7.37. The chest radiograph revealed a left-sided pleural effusion along with infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. The patient did not report any recent changes in mental status, and his neurologic examination was within normal limits. He also did not have a history of malignancy and was not residing in a nursing home at the time of presentation. Given the clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies, the provisional diagnosis was community-acquired pneumonia with a complicating pleural effusion. The patient's known congestive heart failure and elevated glucose levels were noted to be important considerations in his treatment plan. His clinical course was monitored closely with appropriate antibiotics and supportive measures initiated.",

Hematocrit <30%: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n19. Partial pressure of oxygen <60 mmHg or <8 kPa: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n20. Pleural effusion on x-ray: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n\nThe total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n\nThe current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 68 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 68 = 68.\nBecause the patient is male, no adjustments are made to the score, keeping the current total at 68.\nThe patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 68.\nNeoplastic disease is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 68.\nLiver disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 68.\nCHF History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 68 + 10 = 78.\nCerebrovascular disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 78.\nRenal Disease History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 78.\nAltered Mental Status is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 78.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 78 + 10 = 88.\nThe patient's pulse is 93 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 88.\nThe patient's temperature is 37.0 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 88.\nThe patient's pH is 7.37. The patient's pH is greater than or equal to 7.35, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the current total at 88.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 20 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 88.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 116 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 88.\nThe concentration of BUN is 21 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 88.\nThe concentration of sodium is 136 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 136 mEq. To convert from 136 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 136 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 136 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 136.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 136 mEq sodium/L converts to 136.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 88.\nThe concentration of glucose is 180 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 88.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 38 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 88.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 77 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 88.\nThe patient's PSI score is 88.",

        "Patient Note": "An 75-year-old male was brought into the emergency department presenting with a five-day history of increasing shortness of breath, productive cough with yellowish sputum, and episodes of fever. The patient also reported a decreased appetite and generalized weakness during this time. Upon further questioning, his family revealed he has a known history of congestive heart failure but has not had any chronic kidney disease or malignancies. Moreover, they noted a recent change in his mental status over the past two days, characterized by increased confusion. On physical examination, the patient appeared acutely ill and was only partially oriented. His temperature was 38.2 degrees Celsius. Vital signs recorded a heart rate of 100 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, systolic blood pressure of 105 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Auscultation of the lungs revealed decreased breath sounds and fine crackles bilaterally. The cardiovascular examination was unremarkable apart from a regular rhythm with no additional heart sounds. Peripheral edema was noted, consistent with his known cardiac condition. Initial laboratory investigations were significant for a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of 24 mg/dL, serum sodium of 133 mEq/L, serum glucose of 190 mg/dL, and a hematocrit of 36%. Arterial blood gas analysis indicated a pH of 7.32 and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) of 74 mm Hg. Radiographic assessment with a chest X-ray did not show evidence of pleural effusion. The patient's medical history did not include any diagnoses of liver disease, and he has been living independently at home, not in a nursing facility. Based on the clinical presentation, physical findings, and laboratory results, a diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia was considered. The presence of an altered mental state, significant hypoxia, and relatively low blood pressure, combined with elevated BUN, suggests a need for close monitoring and aggressive management. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further treatment, including intravenous antibiotics, supportive care, and continuous monitoring of his respiratory and cardiac status.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI)? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "135",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The rules for computing the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) are shown below:\n\n1. Age: Enter age in years (age score will be equal to age in years)\n2. Sex: Female = -10 points, Male = 0 points\n3. Nursing home resident: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n4. Neoplastic disease: No = 0 points, Yes = +30 points\n5. Liver disease history: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n6. Congestive heart failure (CHF) history: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n7. Cerebrovascular disease history: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n8. Renal disease history: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n9. Altered mental status: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n10. Respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/min: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n11. Systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n12. Temperature <35°C (95°F) or >39.9°C (103.8°F): No = 0 points, Yes = +15 points\n13. Pulse ≥125 beats/min: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n14. pH <7.35: No = 0 points, Yes = +30 points\n15. BUN ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n16. Sodium <130 mmol/L: No = 0 points, Yes = +20 points\n17. Glucose ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n18. Hematocrit <30%: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n19. Partial pressure of oxygen <60 mmHg or <8 kPa: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n20. Pleural effusion on x-ray: No = 0 points, Yes = +10 points\n\nThe total score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n\nThe current PSI score is 0.\nThe patient is 75 years old. We add the the number of years of age of the patient to the psi score, making the current total 0 + 75 = 75.\nBecause the patient is male, no adjustments are made to the score, keeping the current total at 75.\nThe patient is not a nursing home resident and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.\nNeoplastic disease is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.\nLiver disease history is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 75.\nCHF History is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 10 points to the score, making the current total 75 + 10 = 85.\nCerebrovascular disease history is not reported for the patient and so we assume it to be false. Hence, we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.\nRenal Disease History is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 85.\nAltered Mental Status is determined to be present for the patient and so we add 20 points to the score, making the current total 85 + 20 = 105.\nPleural effusion on x-ray is determined to be false for the patient and so we do not add any points to the current total keeping it at 105.\nThe patient's pulse is 100 beats per minute. The pulse is less than 125 beats per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping it at 105.\nThe patient's temperature is 38.2 degrees celsius. The patient's temperature is greater than 35 degrees celsius and the temperature is less than 39.9 degrees celsius, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 105.\nThe patient's pH is 7.32. The patient's pH is less than 7.35, and so we add 30 points to the score, making the current total 105 + 30 = 135.\nThe patient's respiratory rate is 22 breaths per minute. The patient's respiratory rate is less than 30 breaths per minute and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total score at 135.\nThe patient's systolic blood pressure is 105 mm Hg. The patient's systolic blood pressure is greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.\nThe concentration of BUN is 24 mg/dL. The patient's BUN is less than 30 mg/dL, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.\nThe concentration of sodium is 133 mEq/L. We need to convert the concentration to mmol/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mEq to mmol. The mass of sodium is 133 mEq. To convert from 133 mEq to mmol, convert from mEq to mmol. The compound 133 has a valence of 1, and so divide the valence by the value of mEq to get, 133 mEq/(1 mEq/mmol) = 133.0 mmol sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133 mEq sodium/L converts to 133.0 mmol sodium/L. The patient's sodium is greater than or equal to 130 mmol/L, and so we do not add any points to the score, keeping the total at 135.\nThe concentration of glucose is 190 mg/dL. The patient's glucose concentration is less than or equal to than 250 mg/dL, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.\nThe patient's hematocrit is 36 %. The patient's hematocrit is greater than or equal to 30%, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 74 mm Hg. The patient's partial pressure of oxygen is greater than or equal to 60 mm Hg, and so we not add any points to the current total, keeping it at 135.\nThe patient's PSI score is 135.",

        "Patient Note": "A 54-year-old male presents to the emergency department experiencing severe respiratory distress. His history reveals a progressive shortness of breath over the past few days, with an accompanying dry cough and general feeling of malaise. On examination, he is found to be in acute respiratory failure and is currently intubated and on mechanical ventilation, requiring an adjusted FiO2 of 55% to maintain adequate oxygenation. Initial arterial blood gas analysis shows a PaO2 of 70 mm Hg. The patient demonstrates moderate thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 100,000 /µL. On neurological assessment, he has a decreased level of consciousness, responding to verbal stimuli but remains lethargic with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 11. His liver function tests reveal an elevated bilirubin level of 2.5 mg/dL, indicating hepatic involvement. Vital signs indicate significant hypotension, with his blood pressure recorded at 80/55 mm Hg. Given the clinical scenario, he is currently receiving dopamine at a dosage of 7 mcg/kg/min to support his blood pressure. Renal function tests show a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL. Despite this level, his urine output over the past 24 hours has been adequate, measuring at 1000 mL/day. The clinical picture suggests a patient in severe sepsis with multi-organ involvement, including respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation support, cardiovascular compromise necessitating pharmacological intervention for blood pressure stabilization, hepatic dysfunction with elevated bilirubin, renal impairment noted by a rise in creatinine albeit with preserved urine output, and a depressed level of consciousness. His condition necessitates ongoing intensive monitoring and supportive care within the ICU to address the multi-faceted aspects of his critical illness.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "12",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The criteria for the SOFA Score are shown below:\n    \n1. PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (mm Hg): ≥400 = 0 points, 300-399 = +1 point, 200-299 = +2 points, 100-199 (with respiratory support) = +3 points, <100 (with respiratory support) = +4 points\n2. Platelets (x10³/µL): ≥150 = 0 points, 100-149 = +1 point, 50-99 = +2 points, 20-49 = +3 points, <20 = +4 points\n3. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 15 = 0 points, 13-14 = +1 point, 10-12 = +2 points, 6-9 = +3 points, <6 = +4 points\n4. Bilirubin (mg/dL): <1.2 = 0 points, 1.2-1.9 = +1 point, 2.0-5.9 = +2 points, 6.0-11.9 = +3 points, ≥12.0 = +4 points\n5. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) or administration of vasopressors (in mcg): No hypotension = 0 points, MAP <70 mmHg = +1 point, Dopamine ≤5 or Dobutamine (any dose) = +2 points, Dopamine >5 or Epinephrine ≤0.1 or norepinephrine ≤0.1 = +3 points, Dopamine >15 or Epinephrine >0.1 or norepinephrine >0.1 = +4 points\n6. Creatinine (mg/dL) or urine output: <1.2 = 0 points, 1.2-1.9 = +1 point, 2.0-3.4 = +2 points, 3.5-4.9 or urine output <500 mL/day = +3 points, ≥5.0 or urine output <200 mL/day = +4 points\n\nThe total SOFA Score is calculated by summing the points for each criterion.\n    \nThe patient's current SOFA score is 0.\nThe patient's partial pressure of oxygen is 70 mm Hg and FiO₂ percentage is 55 %. This means that the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is 127.27273. The patient is reported to be on mechanical ventillation. The patient is reported to not be using continuous positive airway pressure. Because the patient's partial pressure of oxygen to FiO₂ ratio is between 100 to 199, and the patient is using at least one of (i) mechanical ventillation or (ii) continious positive airway pressure, we increase the score by three points, makeing the current total 0 + 3 = 3.\nFor three points to be given, the patient must be taking more than 5 micrograms/kg/min, less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min of epinephrine, or less than or equal to 0.1 micrograms/kg/min of norepinephrine. Because at least one of these cases is true for the patient, we increment the score by three points, making the current total 3 + 3 = 6.\nThe patient's glasgow coma score is 11. Because the patient's glasgow coma score is between 10 and 12, we add 2 points to the score, making the current score 6 + 2 = 8.\n The concentration of bilirubin is 2.5 mg/dL. Because the patient's bilirubin concentration is at least 2.0 mg/dL, but less than 6.0 mg/dL, we increment the score by two points, make the current score 8 + 2 = 10.\nThe patient's concentration of platelet is 100000 count/µL. Because the patient's platelet count is between 100*10³/µL but less than 150*10³/µL, we increment the score by one point, making the current score 10 + 1 = 11.\nThe concentration of creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL.

EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units:\n   - PaO2 = 70 mm Hg\n   - FiO2 = 55% (adjusted)\n   - Respiratory support: Yes (intubated and on mechanical ventilation)\n   - Platelet count = 100,000 /µL\n   - GCS = 11\n   - Bilirubin = 2.5 mg/dL\n   - Blood pressure = 80/55 mm Hg (MAP needs to be calculated)\n   - Vasopressor: Dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min\n   - Creatinine = 1.6 mg/dL\n   - Urine output = 1000 mL/day\n\n4.

CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:\n   a. PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio (mm Hg): 127.27 mm Hg. Since the patient is on respiratory support and the ratio is 100-199, this gets +3 points.\n   b. Platelets (x10³/µL): 100 x10³/µL. This falls in the 100-149 range, which gets +1 point.\n   c. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS): 11. This falls in the 10-12 range, which gets +2 points.\n   d. Bilirubin (mg/dL): 2.5 mg/dL. This falls in the 2.0-5.9 range, which gets +2 points.\n   e. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) or administration of vasopressors:\n      - The patient has an MAP of 63.33 mm Hg (<70 mmHg), which is 1 point.\n      - The patient is also receiving Dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min. According to the formula, Dopamine >5 mcg/kg/min or Epinephrine ≤0.1 or norepinephrine ≤0.1 = +3 points. The higher score applies when multiple criteria are met for a single organ system.\n      - Therefore, this gets +3 points.\n   f. Creatinine (mg/dL) or urine output: Creatinine is 1.6 mg/dL (1.2-1.9 range = +1 point). Urine output is 1000 mL/day (not <500 mL/day or <200 mL/day). So, based on creatinine, this gets +1 point.\n\n6. APPLY all modifiers as specified in the formula:\n   - Respiratory: PaO₂/FiO₂ = 127.27 mm Hg (with respiratory support) -> 3 points\n   - Coagulation: Platelets = 100 x10³/µL -> 1 point\n   - Neurological: GCS = 11 -> 2 points\n   - Liver: Bilirubin = 2.5 mg/dL -> 2 points\n   - Cardiovascular: Dopamine at 7 mcg/kg/min (>5 mcg/kg/min) -> 3 points (This is higher than MAP <70 mmHg which would be 1 point, so 3 points apply).\n   - Renal: Creatinine = 1.6 mg/dL -> 1 point\n\n7.

        "Patient Note": "A 20-year-old woman presented with progressively worsening dyspnea for 6 months. She had no history of evaluation or treatment for her symptoms, although the symptoms started at the age of high school. Her symptoms became worse with time, and she presented with NYHA class III exertional dyspnea and orthopnea. Her height, weight, and body surface area were 156 cm, 49 kg, and 1.45 m2 respectively. Her vital signs were blood pressure 104/68 mmHg, heart rate 104/min, and respiratory rate 22/min. A regular heart beat was detected with wide fixed splitting of S2 at the pulmonary valve area, and no clubbing of the fingers or nails was observed. A simple chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly and a dilated pulmonary trunk with cephalization of pulmonary vascular marking. Electrocardiography revealed normal sinus rhythm with compatible findings of RV hypertrophy. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a large tissue defect of 29 mm with a bi-directional shunt through the interatrial septum (). The RV was prominently dilated and revealed significantly decreased contractility with a D-shaped left ventricle (LV) showing normal contractility (). There was no significant RV hypertrophy. The systolic pulmonary arterial pressure measured by maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TR Vmax) was estimated at 95 mmHg (TR Vmax = 4.6 m/sec), which was roughly equal to systemic systolic blood pressure (). Her walking distance was 362 m on the 6-minute walking test with slightly decreased oxygen saturation from 98% to 92%. Further evaluations to identify the etiology of the pulmonary hypertension included a pulmonary function test, chest computed tomography angiogram and autoimmune panel, but all were negative.\nCardiac catheterization confirmed severe pulmonary hypertension with a mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 48 mmHg (76/36 mmHg absolute) and pulmonary vascular resistance (Rp) of 9.6 Wood units (WU) on room air. The mean systemic arterial pressure was 84 mmHg (97/73 mmHg absolute). After administering oxygen (10 L/min for 10 minutes via a nasal prong) and inhaling iloprost, her mean pulmonary arterial pressure was 50 and 46 mmHg respectively, and had not changed significantly. We failed to identify the pulmonary arterial responsibility after pulmonary vasodilator administration. Based on these findings, closure of the ASD was not performed. Instead, medical treatment including oral bosentan was started to improve patient's symptom.\nHer symptoms and exercise tolerance improved from NYHA class III to NYHA class I to II after 1 year of using bosentan. She was able to walk 426 m during the 6-min walk test without desaturation. A follow-up echocardiogram showed no significant interval change except slight improvement in RV contractility compared to the initial echocardiogram, even though her symptoms were much improved. TR Vmax was 4.3 m/sec by continuous wave Doppler test, but there was no significant improvement in comparison with the initial test. Although the follow-up echocardiogram result was very disappointing, we decided to perform a cardiac catheterization and balloon occlusion test to confirm the change in Rp and possibly correct the ASD. We expected some favorable changes in pulmonary vascular physiology, because her exercise tolerance had much improved.\nA follow-up cardiac catheterization revealed severe pulmonary hypertension with mean pulmonary arterial pressure of 45 mmHg (75/29 mmHg absolute). The mean aortic pressure was 74 mmHg (95/60 mmHg absolute). Although the patient still had severe pulmonary hypertension, Rp had decreased markedly from 9.6 to 4.2 WU and calculated pulmonary to systemic flow ratio (Qp/Qs) increased from 1.9 to 2.6 in comparison with the initial data. We performed the transient balloon occlusion test using a 34 mm sizing balloon for 10 minutes. As a result, mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased to 36 mmHg (48/25 mmHg absolute), and mean aortic pressure increased to 85 mmHg (118/70 mmHg absolute). We decided to close the ASD with a transcatheter occluder device considering her young age and the high perioperative risk. We performed percutaneous closure of the defect with a 34 mm Amplatzer® septal occluder (AGA Medical Corp., Minneapolis, MN, USA).\nNo residual leak was observed on the follow-up transthoracic echocardiography. The patient was given antiplatelet therapy and was maintained on 62.5 mg bosentan bid with diuretics and an angiotensin receptor blocker for 1 year. Finally, her physical activity and symptoms were much improved as she could walk 554 m on the walk test 1 year after the device was deployed. A chest X-ray showed remarkably decreased pulmonary vascularity, but cardiomegaly remained. Follow-up transthoracic echocardiography showed increased left atrial size from 37 to 42 mm and LV chamber size of end-diastole/end-systole from 40/23 to 46/28 mm. RV size had decreased significantly, and RV contractility was much improved in comparison with the initial study, but a compressed LV still remained on the parasternal short axis view (). TR Vmax also decreased markedly from 4.6 m/sec to 3.0 m/sec ().",

She specified that she had actually been drinking a lot more water than regular prior to admission.\nOn admission, her vital signs revealed a blood pressure of 101/73 mmHg, a heart rate of 91 beats/min, a temperature of 37.4 degree Celsius, and a respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min. Her body mass index (BMI) was 18.6 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a sick-appearing woman in severe respiratory distress using accessory muscles. She had a dry mucous membrane with poor skin turgor. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.\nOn laboratory assessment, the hemoglobin was 11.9 mg/dl, leukocyte count 3.6/mm3, serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl, potassium 3.3 mmol/L, chloride 110 mmol/L, sodium 148 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 6 mmol/L. Her serum albumin on admission was 4.2 g/dL, urine analysis revealed 80 mg/dl ketones, and serum lactate was 1.9 mmol/L. Furthermore, her liver enzymes revealed aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 48 units/l, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) = 82 units/l, and alkaline phosphatase 199 units/l. Additionally, her blood glucose level was 133 mg/dl, salicylates = 6.8 mg/dl, and acetaminophen level was <2.0 ug/ml. Her blood alcohol level was normal and chest X-ray (CXR) on admission did not show any sign of acute cardiopulmonary problems.\nBased on the initial evaluation, she received stoma suctioning and was placed on high O2 via a tracheostomy mask. Her history of laryngeal cancer, mild tachycardia and hypoxia raised the suspicion of pulmonary embolism, so a chest computed tomography angiography (CTA) was ordered. The chest CTA was negative for pulmonary embolism but showed mild emphysema.\nIn addition to that, an arterial blood gas (ABG) test was done, which revealed a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA) as presented in Table . The patient continued to hyperventilate to compensate for the acidosis and was subsequently intubated.\nDifferential diagnoses including carbon monoxide poisoning, aminoglycoside toxicity, methanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), alcoholic ketosis, acetaminophen toxicity, iron ingestion, lactic acidosis, ethanol toxicity, salicylate toxicity, and aspirin ingestion were investigated. However, given the patient's normal acetaminophen, salicylate, lactic acid, and ethanol levels, these etiologies were ruled out. Furthermore, serum osmolality was normal and the osmolal gap was less than 10. Our differential diagnosis was further narrowed due to the presence of elevated ketones. Given the patient's malnourished state, the most likely cause of HAGMA in this patient was starvation ketosis. The patient was started on 5% dextrose water and sodium bicarbonate drip, and tube feeds. The ABG level swiftly improved within three days and she was extubated.\nAfter four days of intensive care unit (ICU) course, she was downgraded and later on discharged after detailed counseling from a nutritionist regarding a balanced diet and avoiding fasting. She was followed up after three weeks of discharge with significant improvement on repeat basic metabolic panel with bicarbonate of 25 mmol/L, sodium 138 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, and chloride 102 mmol/L.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected delta ratio? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "1.08333",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the albumin corrected delta ratio is albumin corrected delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 148.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 148.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 148.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 148.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 148.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 148.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 110.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 110.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 110.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 110.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 110.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 110.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 6.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 6.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 6.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 6.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 6.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 148.0 mEq/L - (110.0 mEq/L + 6.0 mEq/L) = 32.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 32.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 4.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 32.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.2 (in g/dL)) = 31.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 31.5 mEq/L.Plugging in 31.5 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 31.5 - 12 = 19.5 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected delta gap is 19.5 mEq/L.Plugging in the albumin corrected delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration into the albumin corrected delta ratio formula, we get 19.5 mEq/L / 18.0 mEq/L = 1.08333. The patient's albumin corrected delta ratio is 1.08333.",

        "Patient Note": "A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency room with a chief complaint of marked edema of 5 days' duration. Past medical history included: Bipolar disorder, panic disorder, hypothyroidism, and hidradenitis suppurativa. Her daily home medications included lithium carbonate 900 mg, synthroid 75 μg, cymbalata 60 mg, nortryptiline 30 mg, cipralex 30 mg, gabapentin 600-900 mg, and ibuprofen 200 mg. The patient had been on a stable dose of lithium for approximately 5 years experiencing no side effects. She presented to the hospital with a 5-day history of severe fatigue, migraine-like headaches, lethargy, and significant anasarca. Associated with these symptoms were upper extremity tremors as well as polyuria and polydipsia. She denied chest pain, shortness of breath, constitutional symptoms, and any urinary symptoms. Social history included 10-pack year history of tobacco.\nOn admission, the patient's vital signs were: Blood pressure 115/61, heart rate 61 beats/min, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. The patient was afebrile. There was generalized + 2 edema of lower extremities, upper extremities, and periorbital regions. Minimal bibasilar crackles were appreciated. The remainder of the cardiovascular and abdominal examination was unremarkable.\nBlood work showed a plasma creatinine level of 119 μmol/L (baseline 69 μmol/L) and a blood urea of 10.4 mmol/L. Urine dipstick showed a specific gravity of 1.016, pH 7.5, and 4 + protein; and was negative for glucose, ketones, and nitrites. Microscopy revealed oval fat bodies and free fat droplets. The urine albumin to creatinine ratio was 973.4 mg/mmol and 24-h urine protein was 15.69 g. On admission, serum lithium level was 2.66 mmol/L (therapeutic 0.50-1.50 mmol/L). Serum sodium was 130 mmol/L, potassium 4.5 mmol/L, chloride 105 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 27 mmol/L. A complete blood count demonstrated hemoglobin 106 g/L, white blood cell count 9.46 × 109 /L, and platelet count 234 × 109 /L. Serum albumin was low at 20 g/L; but all liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and coagulation studies were within normal limits. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 18.90 mU/L and free T4 8.2 pmol/L. Serology for hepatitis B and C, anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, ribonucleoprotein, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, inflammatory myositis, and Smith antibody were all negative. Antinuclear antibody was slightly positive on admission. Chest radiographs revealed nonspecific bibasilar infiltrates. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated normal kidneys with no renal calculi or hydronephrosis.\nLithium treatment was discontinued immediately and the patient was treated conservatively with fluids. Initially the patient refused renal biopsy. Once stabilized, she was discharged from the hospital and lithium remained discontinued. At 2 months follow-up, the patient experienced worsening anasarca, significant acute kidney injury (AKI; serum creatinine 209 μmol/L), and persistent proteinuria. She was readmitted to the hospital and subsequently underwent a renal biopsy, when at the time her creatinine peaked at 348 μmol/l. On light microscopy, there was no global sclerosis, crescent formation, or necrotic lesions capillary wall thickness was normal. There was evidence of moderate focal interstitial fibrosis []. Immunofluorescence did not demonstrate any immune deposits. Electron microscopy revealed widespread fusion of podocyte foot processes affecting more than 75% of the surface of glomerular capillary loops []. No electron dense deposits were evident. A diagnosis of MCD secondary to lithium use was established and the patient was started on high dose corticosteroids, initially intravenously, but changed to oral prednisone 80 mg daily on discharge. Over the next 2 months of follow-up, the patient's creatinine, proteinuria, and edema all decreased significantly and she was tapered to oral prednisone 40 mg. At her 4 months follow-up, her albumin/creatinine ratio had decreased to 220 mg/mmol and she remained on oral prednisone 40 mg daily. Her edema as well as AKI had resolved.

Hence, The patient's anion gap is -2.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 20.0 g/L. We need to convert the concentration to g/dL. The mass units of the source and target are the same so no conversion is needed. The current volume unit is L and the target volume unit is dL. The conversion factor is 10.0 dL for every unit of L. Our next step will be to divide the mass by the volume conversion factor of 10.0 to get the final concentration in terms of g/dL. This will result to 20.0 g albumin/10.0 dL = 2.0 g albumin/dL. The concentration value of 20.0 g albumin/L converts to 2.0 g albumin/dL.

Thyroid ultrasonography (US) revealed heterogeneous diffuse goiter without any nodules, cysts, or abscess (Figure ). Doppler US revealed a hypovascular thyroid goiter (Figure ), thus confirming the diagnosis of subacute painful thyroiditis.\nThe patient was admitted to the progressive care unit for sepsis secondary to community-acquired pneumonia, E. coli bacteremia, and subacute painful thyroiditis. She was treated with IV fluids (initially 30 cc/kg bolus then 100 cc/hr maintenance), antibiotics, acetaminophen, and propranolol 20 mg every six hours. The second day, the patient triggered a rapid response due to altered mental status, high fever, profuse sweating, and palpitations. Vital signs showed a temperature of 104.5 F°, heart rate (HR) of 138, blood pressure (BP) 110/60, with 100% oxygen saturation on room air. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia without ST-T wave changes (Figure ). Repeated troponin, lactic acid, and basic metabolic profile were unremarkable. Repeated free thyroxine (FT4) was >8, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was undetectable. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for further management of the thyroid storm. Endocrinology was consulted and recommended cold IV fluids, cooling blankets, acetaminophen 650 mg every six hours, titration of propranolol to 40 mg every six hours, with a target HR <100, hydrocortisone 100 mg once then 50 mg every six hours, and one cholestyramine packet every eight hours. On the third day, repeat FT4 was still >8, with slight clinical improvement of mental status. Endocrinology recommended starting a trial of propylthiouracil (PTU) of 150 mg every eight hours with FT4 daily. Over the next few days, the patient improved significantly and FT4 started to trend down (>8, >8, 6.46, 4.75, 3.48, 2.88,1.58, and 1.33). The patient was transferred out of the ICU, and propranolol, corticosteroids, cholestyramine, and PTU were tapered off over the next few days before she was discharged home. On her follow-up at the endocrinology clinic, her symptoms completely resolved. Repeat thyroid function tests were within normal limits.",

        "Ground Truth Answer": "-10.0",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "To compute the formula of albumin corrected delta gap, the formula is albumin corrected anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12.\nThe formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 126.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 102.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 28.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 126.0 mEq/L - (102.0 mEq/L + 28.0 mEq/L) = -4.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -4.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 1.6 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -4.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 1.6 (in g/dL)) = 2.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 2.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 2.0 mEq/L for the anion gap into the albumin corrected delta gap formula, we get 2.0 - 12 = -10.0 mEq/L.

History of loss of appetite, vomiting was also elicited, he also gave a history of smoking and alcohol consumption. Patient was advised an ultrasonogram (USG) along with biochemical and hematological investigation. Routine examination of urine was done which revealed few red blood cells. No atypical or malignant cells are seen in three consecutive specimen of urine for cytology His renal function tests were markedly deranged, with blood urea 346 mg/dl, serum creatinine 25 mg/dl and deranged electrolytes. His blood pressure was raised 230/100 mmHg and fundoscopy showed hypertensive retinopathy. USG showed features of cystitis with hypoechoic areas extending into the thickened bladder wall with features of pyelonephritis. An infective pathology was offered as diagnosis on imaging. A clinical diagnosis of bilateral obstructive uropathy due to tumor with chronic kidney disease was made, and the patient was put on hemodialysis and cystoscopy planned at a later date. Cystoscopy findings were of a growth with small fronds/papillae, prominent at the bladder neck with a very rigid thickened bladder wall. Trans urethral resection of the bladder tumor was done and sent for histopathological evaluation. The microscopic evaluation showed a high-grade tumor arranged in discohesive cords and sheet with plasmacytoid features and prominent retraction artifact [] penetrating through the entire bladder wall into the serosa. Histopathological features of the malignant epithelial cells were uncommon and lead to a differential diagnosis of undifferentiated transitional carcinoma, metastatic or primary lymphoma plasmacytoma, lymphoepithelioma-like bladder carcinoma and a plasmacytoid variant of bladder tumor. Immunohistochemistry was done for CD138, cytokeratin (CK) CK7, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), κ and λ light chain, with positivity for CK7, CD138 [Figures and ] and negative for other markers.

On admission, generalized edema was noted. Her external genitalia were normal female. Laboratory findings showed: hemoglobin, 9.8 g/dL; cholesterol, 120 mg/dL; total serum protein, 3.7 g/dL; serum albumin, 1.5 g/dL; BUN, 75 mg/dL; serum creatinine, 4.1 mg/dL; total calcium, 5.9 mg/dL; phosphorus, 12.7 mg/dL; sodium, 136 mEq/L; potassium, 5.5 mEq/L; chloride, 113 mEq/L; bicarbonate 7.8 mEq/L. Albuminuria and hematuria were detected. An ultrasonogram revealed enlarged kidneys with increased parenchymal echogenicity and poor corticomedullary differentiation. A renal biopsy was performed at the age of 29 days and light microscopy showed small glomeruli with various degrees of mesangial sclerosis (). The tubules were dilated with regenerative activity. Her karyotype was 46 XX. Analysis of the sequence of WT1 exon 9 revealed the presence of a heterozygous G to T base substitution, converting 396Asp to 396Tyr, and a heterozygous 395 Ser (TCC) > Ser (TCA) polymorphism (). Both parents showed normal sequence at these sites. Peritoneal dialysis was commenced with a temporary shift to hemodiafiltration because of dialysate leakage at the exit site. Sustained hypertension (120/80 mmHg) responded to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

        "Patient Note": "A 64-year-old man with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and liver failure secondary to hepatitis C, with status post liver transplant 13 years priorly, was brought in by ambulance to the emergency department for acutely altered mental status. The patient had been in his usual state of health, until he told his family 3 hours before that he “felt sick.” The family incidentally found him on the floor, confused and lethargic, and immediately called the ambulance.\nUpon arrival, the patient had a temperature of 96.4°F; pulse, 117 beats per minute; blood pressure, 151/93 mmHg; respiratory rate, 22 breaths per minute; and oxygen saturation of 100% on nonrebreather. The patient was known to have a history of recurrent episodes of hepatic encephalopathy, and his last episode of hepatic encephalopathy was in the prior 3 months, which was treated and controlled with lactulose. The patient's family stated that the patient had run out of lactulose 4 days before presentation. Other than lactulose, the patient was compliant with all of his home medications, including amlodipine, buproprion, cyclosporine, hydrocodone, lasix, methocarbamol, and ramipril. The patient had no known history of seizure, recent illness, brain trauma, or recent surgical procedures.\nPhysical examination showed a male in no acute distress with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 12 (eyes, 4; verbal, 3; motor, 5). There were no signs of trauma found on his body. His pupils were equally round and reactive to light, and his neck was supple and soft with a cervical collar in place. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable except for tachycardia. Abdominal examination was unremarkable. Because he was not following commands, the neurologic examination was limited. However, the patient was able to move all extremities equally and pulses were distally equal to all extremities. There was no posturing or clonus noted, and Babinski was downgoing in both feet.\nFingerstick glucose level was 210 mg/dL and bedside hemoglobin level was 13.1 g/dL. Noncontrast head and cervical spine computed tomography revealed no acute pathologic lesion. Chest radiography also showed no acute pathologic lesion. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell counts of 5.5 K/mm3 with 60% neutrophils, hematocrit of 36.5%, and platelets of 115 K/mm3. Electrolyte and liver function results were as follows: sodium, 141 mmol/L; potassium, 3.5 mmol/L; chloride, 104 mmol/L; bicarbonate, 22 mmol/L; calcium, 9.3 mg/dL; blood urea nitrogen, 71 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.9 mg/dL; total bilirubin, 2.1 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase, 128 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 124 U/L; alkaline phosphatase, 231 U/L; albumin, 4.0 g/dL; lipase, 30 U/L; prothrombin time, 14.5 seconds; INR, 1.09; and ammonia, 501 μmol/L (reference range, 15–55 μmol/L). Toxicology serum screen results were negative for acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethanol. Urine toxicology screen results were positive only for opiates. Venous blood gas was pH 7.44.\nOwing to the patient's obtunded condition and inability to protect his airway, the patient was electively intubated and given midazolam drip for sedation. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring with a presumed diagnosis of hepatic encephalopathy. While administration of empiric antibiotics was started in the emergency department, it was discontinued after an infectious etiology was deemed unlikely and culture results were negative. Results of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan were also negative, including no evidence of infarct.\nDuring the ICU stay, the patient was readministered lactulose, and ammonia levels decreased to117 μmol/L by hospital day 2 and to 78 μmol/L by hospital day 4. Despite discontinuation of sedation, the patient remained unresponsive. A neurologist was consulted and a bedside electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed findings consistent with status epilepticus. However, the patient had no clinical manifestations of status epilepticus, leading to a diagnosis of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A phenytoin load was immediately administered, while a midazolam infusion was restarted, ultimately leading to EEG resolution of the status epilepticus. The patient did not immediately improve neurologically during the hospitalization stay and was ultimately transferred to another facility for continued treatment and rehabilitation.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "15.0",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 141.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 141.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 141.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 141.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 141.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 141.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 104.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 104.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 104.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 104.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 104.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 104.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 22.0 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 22.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 22.0 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 22.0 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 22.0 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 141.0 mEq/L - (104.0 mEq/L + 22.0 mEq/L) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 4.0 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get 15.0 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 4.0 (in g/dL)) = 15.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is 15.0 mEq/L.",

            "step_by_step_thinking": "1. **VERIFY:** The task is to calculate the patient's albumin corrected anion gap using the provided formulas. The formulas are: `albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap + 2.5 * (4 - albumin)` and `anion_gap = sodium - (chloride + bicarbonate)`. These formulas are directly applicable to the task.\n2. **LIST all variables and coefficients from the formula:**\n   - `anion_gap` (intermediate variable)\n   - `sodium` (mEq/L)\n   - `chloride` (mEq/L)\n   - `bicarbonate` (mEq/L)\n   - `albumin` (g/dL)\n   - Coefficient: `2.5`\n   - Constant: `4`\n3. **EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units:**\n   - From the 'Electrolyte and liver function results':\n     - `sodium`: 141 mmol/L\n     - `chloride`: 104 mmol/L\n     - `bicarbonate`: 22 mmol/L\n     - `albumin`: 4.0 g/dL\n4. **CONVERT units to match formula requirements:**\n   - Sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate are given in mmol/L. For electrolytes, mmol/L is equivalent to mEq/L, so no conversion is needed. \n   - Albumin is given in g/dL, which matches the formula's requirement.\n   - `sodium` = 141 mEq/L\n   - `chloride` = 104 mEq/L\n   - `bicarbonate` = 22 mEq/L\n   - `albumin` = 4.0 g/dL\n5. **CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:**\n   - First, calculate the `anion_gap`:\n     `anion_gap` = `sodium` - (`chloride` + `bicarbonate`)\n     `anion_gap` = 141 - (104 + 22)\n     `anion_gap` = 141 - 126\n     `anion_gap` = 15 mEq/L\n   - Next, calculate the `albumin_corrected_anion_gap`:\n     `albumin_corrected_anion_gap` = `anion_gap` + 2.5 * (4 - `albumin`)\n     `albumin_corrected_anion_gap` = 15 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.0)\n     `albumin_corrected_anion_gap` = 15 + 2.5 * (0)\n     `albumin_corrected_anion_gap` = 15 + 0\n     `albumin_corrected_anion_gap` = 15 mEq/L\n6. **APPLY all modifiers as specified in the formula:** There are no further modifiers specified in the formula.\n7. **VERIFY your calculation is correct:**\n   - Anion gap: 141 - (104 + 22) = 141 - 126 = 15 mEq/L. This calculation is correct.\n   - Albumin corrected anion gap: 15 + 2.5 * (4 - 4.0) = 15 + 2.5 * 0 = 15 mEq/L. This calculation is correct.\n8. **ROUND only at the final step to appropriate precision:** The result is an integer, so no rounding is needed. The precision is mEq/L."

        "Patient Note": "A previously healthy 16-year-old woman had visited her primary care physician with a fever (39°C) and cough 2 days before presenting to our hospital. She was diagnosed with pneumonia (based on chest X-ray findings) and was prescribed tosufloxacin 150 mg thrice daily. However, her fever and cough persisted and she developed papules on both legs the next day (); this prompted her to visit our hospital. Lymphoid follicles with a maximum diameter of 9 mm were identified in the posterior pharyngeal wall (). A throat swab was positive for M. pneumoniae (loop-mediated isothermal amplification method), leading to a diagnosis of mycoplasmal pneumonia. The patient was prescribed oral azithromycin 500 mg daily and oral fexofenadine 60 mg twice daily for 3 days. One week later, her symptoms had resolved. An oral tosufloxacin challenge test, performed 2 months later, was negative. Therefore, the skin rash was determined to have been associated with M. pneumoniae infection.\nLymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall can occur as a result of viral infections such as adenovirus and echovirus; these can be distinguished by shape from the characteristic influenza follicles as presented by Miyamoto and Watanabe. Although posterior pharyngeal wall lymphoid follicles do not normally occur with bacterial infections, we have presented two cases in which these lesions were observed in association with M. pneumoniae infection. These mycoplasma-associated lymphoid follicles were larger than those associated with influenza and other typical viral infections, which have a maximum diameter of approximately 10 mm. They were few in number, were teardrop-shaped with well-defined borders and exhibited flushing. Five characteristics—diameter, shape, presence or absence of agglutination, and colouration—are used to assess the typical lymphoid follicles seen in cases of influenza virus infection. The lesions in our cases matched all characteristics except for their diameter. The frequency of lymphoid follicles in the posterior pharyngeal wall in such cases is unknown; further case studies must be accumulated.",

        "Patient Note": "A patient is a right-handed 59-year-old male, a regular alcohol consumer, and a chronic smoker, who noticed a sudden onset unable to extend right wrist and fingers one hour after waking up from an uneventful night sleep. He had Type IIb dyslipidemia for two years on atorvastatin with no other comorbidities. He admitted to having a binge of alcohol the night before, and he was referred to us as retrohumeral radial nerve palsy. No history of major hemorrhagic events.\nOn neurologic examination, he was alert and oriented and cooperated well during the entire examination. Motor examination demonstrated weakness of the right wrist and finger extensor muscles with a muscle strength grading of 2? Medical Research Council Scale (MRC), with normal strength right brachioradialis, triceps, biceps, flexors of the fingers and wrist as well as the thenar and hypothenar muscles []. Sensory examination did not reveal any impairment in sensation over the dorsal aspect of the right hand. Since neurologic examination did not show any evidence of a central origin of his neurologic deficits, a nerve conduction study and needle electromyography (EMG) were done immediately upon admission which were normal.\nThe constellation of sudden onset of distal radial motor weakness without any accompanying upper motor neuron signs, a normal neurography and EMG, history of dyslipidemia, a 20-year history of alcohol consumption (4 units/day), and 20 pack-years of tobacco smoking prompted us to undertake an emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) on the same day, considering the stroke masquerader of pseudoradial peripheral palsy. INR was within normal limits. The MRI revealed an acute left precentral gyrus infarction, hyperintense on T2, FLAIR, and T1 hypointense with restricted diffusion on DWI along with watershed left MCA-PCA (middle cerebral artery-posterior cerebral artery) left parietal area infarction []. Intracranial MRA, carotid artery Doppler ultrasonography, echocardiography, complete blood picture, vasculitis screen, HIV and treponema serology, antiphospholipid antibodies, and relevant stroke workup were normal except for hyperhomocysteinemia of 18.9 mmol/L. He was initiated on Triple therapy with dual antiplatelet agents, atorvastatin, and ramipril along with folate. Over the ensuing 2 weeks of admission, he demonstrated improvement in his right-hand weakness with the strength of the extensor of the wrist and fingers graded as 3+ MRC at the time of his discharge. During the subsequent neurology follow-up over a 2-month period, he has made a complete motoric recovery.",

        "Patient Note": "A 63-year-old male was admitted after sustaining an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) just 10 days ago. Cardiovascular risk factors included diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking. Despite aggressive medical therapy, frequent rest angina and short of breath recurred at the time of admission to our hospital. Physical examination revealed fine wet rales in the bottom part of the lung. Laboratory values showed troponin I (TnI) of 1.17 ng/mL (normal range 0 - 0.05 ng/mL), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 4.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 93 μmol/L, fasting plasma glucose of 9.64 mmol/L, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.7%, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) of 1,958.5 pg/mL (normal range 0 - 125 pg/mL). Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and anterior precordial leads ST-segment elevation and T waves inversion (). An echocardiogram revealed an enlarged left ventricular cavity (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension 61 mm, left ventricular end-systolic dimension 42 mm) and a nearly normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 53% with segmental wall-motion abnormalities: hypokinesis in anterior wall and the septum. The diagnosis of subacute anterior STEMI was made based on the history and clinical examination. Cardiac catheterization revealed a subtotal occlusion in the proximal and middle part of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), mild stenosis in the left main coronary artery (LM) () and diffuse lesion in the proximal and 85% stenosis in the distal part of right coronary artery (RCA) (). According to the patient’s SYNTAX score of 22, we decided to perform PCI for these lesions.\nAfter predilation with 1.5 × 15 mm and 2.0 × 20 mm Ryujin balloons (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), two sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) were implanted successfully: Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.75 × 23 mm in middle LAD and Excel (JW Medical, Shandong, China) 3.0 × 24 mm in the proximal LAD (2 to 3-mm overlap at the ends). Post-dilation was performed with a non-compliance 3.0 × 24 mm Maverick Quantum balloon (Boston Scientific, Boston, MA). TIMI-3 flow was noted and no significant residual stenosis remained (). After the procedure, daily oral DAPT of clopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin (ASA) 300 mg were prescribed. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist tirofiban was initially given as rapid intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/min for 30 min. Upon completion of the initial infusion, the rate is decreased to 0.15 μg/kg/min delivered as continuous infusion for about 36 h.\nApproximately 2 h after the end of tirofiban administration, the patient developed severe chest pain and T-wave pseudonormalization in the anterior leads on ECG. He was immediately moved to the catheterization lab for repeat coronary angiography (CAG) and ST was found in LAD (). In consideration of the possibility of a dissection at the proximal stent edge (), an additional SES of Partner 3.0 × 21 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) was deployed, overlapping the previous proximal stent edge, with an excellent final result (). Then, Partner 4.0 × 15 mm (Lepu Medical, Beijing, China) and Taxus 4.0 × 38 mm (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) were implanted in the distal and proximal segment of RCA, respectively (). The patient’s clopidogrel dose was increased to 75 mg twice a day because he was found to be hyporesponsive to clopidogrel when tested for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation utilizing with light transmission aggregometry (LTA). He did not taking any drugs that could deteriorate the platelet function, including proton pump inhibitor. Tirofiban was given as continuous infusion for about 72 h. The patient had an uneventful recovery in the following 5 days.\nUnfortunately, the patient again underwent severe chest pain in the sixth day after the second PCI, and the ECG showed ST-segment elevation in V1-V5 leads (). Misgiving about the uncertainty of the reason for recurrent ST, surgeons refused to perform coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After failure of initial thrombolytic therapy, he underwent emergent salvage angiography by a different interventionalist. Emergency CAG showed total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Thrombi were aspirated with the Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) revealed inadequate stent expansion due to elastic recoil (). This was repaired by repeated high-pressure post-dilation with 3.0 × 12 mm and 3.5 × 15 mm NC Sprinter balloons (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) (). Despite the double dose of clopidogrel therapy, ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel. The patient had an uncomplicated recovery and was discharged 1 week later with triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid).\nThe patient’s chest pain recurred again 6 days thereafter. Repeat emergent CAG revealed patent RCA stents and total occlusion of the mid-LAD due to ST (). Surgeons still refused to perform CABG for this patient. Diver CE aspiration catheter (Invatec, Brescia, Italy) was used again. Given the possibility of a dissection at the distal stent edge (), we deployed another SES of Firebird (MicroPort Medical, Shanghai, China) 2.5 × 29 mm in distal-LAD, overlapping the previous distal stent edge. The final result revealed no residual stenosis or dissection and excellent TIMI-3 flow (). Upon completion of continuous infusion of tirofiban for about 7 days, the patient was discharged. He was hemodynamically stable and symptom-free at the time of discharge. Echocardiogram revealed a decreased LVEF of 48%. Laboratory retest showed low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 1.6 mmol/L, creatinine of 96 μmol/L, and fasting plasma glucose of 6.02 mmol/L. Although the patient has complied strictly with the triple anti-platelet therapy (aspirin 300 mg qd, clopidogrel 75 mg bid, and cilostazol 100 mg bid), ADP-induced platelet aggregation showed that she was still hyporesponsive to clopidogrel. Given the very complicated recent course, no further interventions were undertaken. Fortunately, the patient has been symptom-free at follow-ups.",

Past history was significant for repeated episodes of muscle weakness. At that time, she was diagnosed to have hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HPP) and started on oral potassium supplementation. Her physical examination was normal except for subtrochanteric fractures of bilateral femora. There was no muscle weakness of both upper limbs. The power in the lower limbs could not be tested due to fractures of both femora. On investigation, serum creatinine was 1.4 mg/dl, BUN 26 mg/dl, S. Na+ - 133 mmol/L, S. K+ 2.7 mmol/L, S. Ca++ 9.7 mg/dl, Cl − - 122 mmol/L, S.phosphorus 2.1 mg/dl, uric acid 2 mg/dl, S.bilirubin 0.5 mg/dl, SGOT 42 U/L, SGPT 23 U/L, S.albumin 3.2 g/dl, bicarbonate 20.2 mmol/L, and alkaline phosphatase 837 mg/dl. Her Vitamin D3 was 10 ng/ml and S. PTH 38.5 pg/ml. Her thyroid function tests were normal. Analysis of arterial blood gases (ABGs) (on room air) revealed pH of 7.22, PaO2 of 61, PCO2 of 23, HCO3 of 11.3 with base deficit of - 17 mmol/L, Na+ - 139 meq/L, K+ 2.3 mmol/L, Ca++ 0.41 mmol/L. The urinary pH was 7.5. On radiological evaluation, there was an acute pathological subtrochanteric fracture of left femur, old subtrochanteric fracture of the right femur and left proximal fibula. On ultrasound abdomen, there was dystrophic parenchymal calcification in the left kidney and mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter on the right side. Tc-99m diethylene triamine penta acetic acid revealed nonfunctioning left kidney with the normally functioning right kidney. Electrocardiography (ECG) was normal except for frequent ventricular ectopics. Transthoracic echocardiography was normal. A bone scan showed avid uptake of tracer in right sixth rib, left seventh rib, bilateral proximal femora, left proximal fibula, shaft of the right humerus, and renal cortex [].\nBased on the above findings, the patient was diagnosed to have RTA (distal or type 1, normal anion gap hyperchloremic acidosis) with hypokalemia, nephrocalcinosis, and metabolic bone disease. Surgery was deferred in order to optimize the condition of the patient. The goal of therapy was to maintain serum pH of >7.3 and S. K+ >3 mmol/L. She was started on potassium supplementation intravenously (IV), followed by oral potassium 21 meq tid, tablet alfacalcidol 0.25 mcg, oral sodium bicarbonate 1 g (11.9 mmol) thrice a day, and oral calcium 500 mg BD. After 4 days, ABG analysis showed pH 7.307, PaO296 mmHg, PCO225 mm Hg, HCO312.3 mmol/L with base deficit of - 12.6 mmol/L, K+ 3.1 mmol/L, and Ca++ 0.92 mmol/L. She was posted for interlocking nailing of fracture of left femur to be followed by right femur after 2 days.\nOn the day of surgery, she was premedicated with tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet pantoprazole 40 mg 2 h prior to shifting to the operation theatre (OT). In the OT, standard monitors were attached and wide bore IV access was secured. Radial arterial cannulation was done for continuous blood pressure monitoring and ABG analysis. Under strict aseptic precautions, epidural space was located in sitting position at L3-4 intervertebral space through a median approach by the loss of resistance to air with an 18G Tuohy needle. A subarachnoid block was established with the administration of 3 ml of 0.5% heavy bupivacaine with 25 μg of fentanyl via 27G spinal needle (needle through needle technique). A 22G epidural catheter was passed into the epidural space and fixed at 9 cm. The time taken for onset of the subarachnoid block was approximately 5-6 min and the highest level of the block (T8) was achieved within 13 min. During the procedure, which lasted for 120 min, 1.5 L of ringer lactate was infused and normal saline was avoided. IV sodium bicarbonate and potassium supplementation were given based on ABG findings so as to maintain pH of more than 7.3 and >3 -5 mEq/L. A total of 50 meq of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate and 10 meq of potassium chloride were infused. Intraoperative vitals were stable, blood loss was approximately 300 ml, and urine output was 20-40 ml/h. For postoperative analgesia, a bolus of 8 ml of 0.2% ropivacaine (after a test dose of 3 ml of 2% lignocaine without epinephrine) was given epidurally and an infusion of 0.2% ropivacaine was started at 6 ml/h. The operation on the contralateral femur was done under epidural anesthesia 2 days later. Postoperatively, ECG was continuously monitored and ABG analysis was done twice a day for 3 days. Oral bicarbonate and potassium supplements were continued and additional IV supplementation was given as required. She was discharged on the 10th postoperative day.",
        "Question": "What is the patient's albumin corrected anion gap in mEq/L? You should use the patient's medical values and health status when they were first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment.",
        "Ground Truth Answer": "-7.2",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing a patient's albumin corrected anion gap is: anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL)).\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 133.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of sodium from mmol to mEq. The mass of sodium is 133.0 mmol. The compound, sodium, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 133.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 133.0 mEq sodium. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 133.0 mmol sodium/L converts to 133.0 mEq sodium/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 122.0 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of chloride from mmol to mEq. The mass of chloride is 122.0 mmol. The compound, chloride, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 122.0 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 122.0 mEq chloride. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 122.0 mmol chloride/L converts to 122.0 mEq chloride/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 20.2 mmol/L. We need to convert the concentration to mEq/L. Let's first convert the mass of bicarbonate from mmol to mEq. The mass of bicarbonate is 20.2 mmol. The compound, bicarbonate, has a valence of 1, and so multiply the valence by the value of mmol to get, 20.2 mmol * 1 mEq/mmol = 20.2 mEq bicarbonate. The volume units is L so no volume conversion is needed. Hence, the concentration value of 20.2 mmol bicarbonate/L converts to 20.2 mEq bicarbonate/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 133.0 mEq/L - (122.0 mEq/L + 20.2 mEq/L) = -9.2 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is -9.2 mEq/L.The concentration of albumin is 3.2 g/dL. Plugging in these values into the albumin corrected anion gap formula, we get -9.2 (mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - 3.2 (in g/dL)) = -7.2 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's albumin corrected anion gap is -7.2 mEq/L.",

The formulas are: \n1. `albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap (in mEq/L) + 2.5 * (4 - albumin (in g/dL))`\n2. `anion_gap = sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L) + bicarbonate (mEq/L))`\nThese formulas are appropriate for the task.\n\nStep 2: List all variables and coefficients from the formula.\nVariables required for `anion_gap`: `sodium`, `chloride`, `bicarbonate`.\nVariables required for `albumin_corrected_anion_gap`: `anion_gap`, `albumin`.\nCoefficients/constants: `2.5`, `4`.\n\nStep 3: Extract exact values from the patient note with correct units.\nThe task specifies using values from when the patient was first admitted to the hospital prior to any treatment. We look for serum investigation results:\n- `S. Na+`: 133 mmol/L\n- `Cl −`: 122 mmol/L\n- `bicarbonate`: 20.2 mmol/L\n- `S.albumin`: 3.2 g/dl\n\nStep 4: Convert units to match formula requirements.\n- Sodium (Na+): 133 mmol/L. Since 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L for monovalent ions, this is 133 mEq/L.\n- Chloride (Cl-): 122 mmol/L. Since 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L, this is 122 mEq/L.\n- Bicarbonate (HCO3-): 20.2 mmol/L. Since 1 mmol/L = 1 mEq/L, this is 20.2 mEq/L.\n- Albumin: 3.2 g/dL. This unit matches the formula requirement.\nAll units are consistent with the formula requirements.\n\nStep 5: Calculate by substituting values into the formula.\nFirst, calculate the `anion_gap`:\n`anion_gap = sodium - (chloride + bicarbonate)`\n`anion_gap = 133 mEq/L - (122 mEq/L + 20.2 mEq/L)`\n`anion_gap = 133 - (142.2)`\n`anion_gap = 133 - 142.2`\n`anion_gap = -9.2 mEq/L`\n\nNext, calculate the `albumin_corrected_anion_gap`:\n`albumin_corrected_anion_gap = anion_gap + 2.5 * (4 - albumin)`\n`albumin_corrected_anion_gap = -9.2 + 2.5 * (4 - 3.2)`\n`albumin_corrected_anion_gap = -9.2 + 2.5 * (0.8)`\n`albumin_corrected_anion_gap = -9.2 + 2.0`\n`albumin_corrected_anion_gap = -7.2 mEq/L`\n\nStep 6: Apply all modifiers as specified in the formula.\nNo additional modifiers (e.g., age, sex, race) are specified in the provided formulas.\n\nStep 7: Verify the calculation is correct.\nAnion gap: 133 - (122 + 20.2) = 133 - 142.2 = -9.2.

Down syndrome was suspected clinically at birth and confirmed by karyotyping (47XX, t21).\nThe body weight on admission was 14.5 kg and the body height was 93 cm (20th and 5th percentile for sex and age in Down syndrome, respectively) ().\nTypical features of Down syndrome were present, including typical facies and generalized hypotonia. A 3/6 heart murmur was heard on auscultation, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a low grade aortic regurgitation. The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable.\nLaboratory studies revealed red blood cell count 2.14 × 1012/l, Hb 6.1 gr/dL, Htc 17.5%, platelet count 272000/mm3, white blood cell count 7800/mm3, ESR 60 mm/h, CRP 26 mg/l, urea 12.7 mmol/1, creatinine 160 umol/1, Na 136 mEq/L, K 2.7 mEq/L, Cl 108 mEq/L, Ca 9.8 mg/dL, ionised Ca 1.28 mmol/1, Mg 1.0 mmol/1, total serum proteins 59.6 g/l, albumins 32.3 g/l, fasting blood glucose 5.6 mmol/l, cholesterol 6,1 mmol/l, triglycerides 2.3 mmol/l and alkaline phosphatase 49 U/l.

The formula is appropriate for this task as it contains 'TraMADol (Oral)' and its corresponding morphine equivalent.\n2. **LIST all variables and coefficients from the formula:**\n   - TraMADol (Oral) corresponds to 120 mg of Morphine Equivalents.\n3. **EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units:**\n   - Patient takes 30 mg of TraMADol per dose.\n   - Patient takes 2 doses per day.\n4. **CONVERT units to match formula requirements:** No unit conversions are needed as the given dosage (mg) matches the formula's units for calculation.\n   - Daily TraMADol dose = 30 mg/dose * 2 doses/day = 60 mg/day.\n5. **CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:**\n   - From the table, 120 mg of TraMADol (Oral) is equivalent to 30 mg of Morphine.\n   - We need to find the morphine equivalent for 60 mg of TraMADol (Oral).\n   - Set up a ratio: (60 mg TraMADol) / (120 mg TraMADol) = (X mg Morphine) / (30 mg Morphine)\n   - X = (60 / 120) * 30\n   - X = 0.5 * 30\n   - X = 15 mg Morphine Equivalents.\n6. **APPLY all modifiers as specified in the formula:** No specific modifiers are mentioned in the formula beyond the direct conversion factor.\n7. **VERIFY your calculation is correct before giving the final answer:** The calculation seems correct. 60 mg of Tramadol is half of 120 mg, so the MME should be half of 30 mg, which is 15 mg.\n8. **ROUND only at the final step to appropriate precision:** The result is an exact integer, so no rounding is needed.",

This formula is appropriate for the task.\n2. LIST all variables and coefficients from the formula:\n   - Fever in past 24 hours: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n   - Absence of cough or coryza: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n   - Symptom onset ≤3 days: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n   - Purulent tonsils: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n   - Severe tonsil inflammation: No = 0 points, Yes = +1 point\n3. EXTRACT exact values from the patient note with correct units:\n   - Fever: \"fevers\" for the past 3 weeks. Current temperature is 37.8°C (100°F). The note states \"fevers\" which implies a fever has been present. A temperature of 37.8°C (100°F) at presentation also indicates fever.\n   - Cough or coryza: Not mentioned in the patient note.\n   - Symptom onset: \"sore throat, fevers, and fatigue for the past 3 weeks\".\n   - Purulent tonsils: \"enlarged tonsils with exudates\". Exudates are consistent with purulent tonsils.\n   - Severe tonsil inflammation: \"enlarged tonsils with exudates\" and \"pharyngeal erythema\" suggest inflammation, and \"enlarged tonsils with exudates\" can be considered severe. The formula's term \"Severe tonsil inflammation\" is subjective, but given the presence of exudates and enlargement, it aligns.\n4. CONVERT units to match formula requirements: No unit conversions are needed.\n5. CALCULATE by substituting values into the formula:\n   - Fever in past 24 hours: The patient presents with a temperature of 37.8°C (100°F) and has a history of \"fevers.\" This indicates 'Yes' = +1 point.\n   - Absence of cough or coryza: Cough or coryza are not mentioned in the patient's symptoms. This means there is an 'Absence' of cough or coryza = +1 point.\n   - Symptom onset ≤3 days: Symptom onset was \"3 weeks\" ago, which is not ≤3 days. This means 'No' = 0 points.\n   - Purulent tonsils: The note states \"enlarged tonsils with exudates.\" Exudates are considered purulent. This means 'Yes' = +1 point.\n   - Severe tonsil inflammation: The note states \"enlarged tonsils with exudates\" and \"pharyngeal erythema\". Enlarged tonsils with exudates indicate severe tonsil inflammation. This means 'Yes' = +1 point.\n   Total FeverPAIN score = 1 (Fever) + 1 (Absence of cough or coryza) + 0 (Symptom onset >3 days) + 1 (Purulent tonsils) + 1 (Severe tonsil inflammation).\n   Total FeverPAIN score = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4 points.\n6.

        "Patient Note": "A fifty-seven-year-old female presented to emergency room with altered mental status, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient was in usual state of health 2 days before presentation, when she developed intermittent dull epigastric pain. The patient was able to tolerate the pain initially, but on day of presentation the pain became severe and persistent and she started having nonbilious vomiting. She also became somnolent and tachypneic and therefore the decision was made to bring her to the emergency room. Her past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus and she was on insulin monotherapy. The family reported that for the last few weeks the patient was noncompliant with using insulin. On initial evaluation her vital signs were remarkable for temperature of 37 degree Celsius, pulse of 120/minutes, blood pressure (BP) of 134/78 mmHg, respiratory rate of 24 breath/minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on 2-liter nasal cannula. Pertinent examination findings included obtunded patient who did not wake up to deep sternal rub, dry oral mucosa, and a weak gag reflex. Her pulmonary and cardiovascular examination was unremarkable. Admission labs indicated severe uncompensated metabolic acidosis with arterial blood gas showing pH of 7.02, PaCO2 of 14, PaO2 of 134, calculated bicarbonate of 4, and oxygen saturation of 97%. Serum chemistries indicated sodium 137 mEq/L (136–145 mEq/L), potassium 4.4 mEq/L (3.5–5.1 mEq/L), chloride 82 mEq/L (97–109 mEq/L), bicarbonate 10 mEq/L (23–32 mEq/L), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 32 mg/dL (7–17 mg/dL), serum creatinine 2.84 mg/dL (0.7–1.1 mg/dL), serum glucose 172 mg/dL (66–111 mg/dL), and measured serum osmolality 324 mOsm/kg (280–300 mOsm/kg). Her urine analysis was positive for ketones. Urine and serum drug screen was positive for cocaine. Other labs including complete blood count, lactic acid, serum Tylenol levels, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Admission chest roentgenogram was unremarkable ().\nGiven concern for severe uncompensated metabolic acidosis and decreased sensorium, the patient was intubated for airway protection. Initial differential diagnosis included toxic alcohol ingestion, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis, alcoholic ketoacidosis, and starvation ketoacidosis. The serum ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and propylene glycol were undetectable on admission labs and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels were significantly elevated 15.95 mmol/L (0.02–0.27 mmol/L) confirming the diagnosis of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. As the patient's blood glucose was 172 mg/dL on admission, we initially administered 1 liter bolus of intravenous (IV) 5% Dextrose and 0.45% normal saline (D5-1/2 NS), followed by a maintenance rate of 250 cc/hour, supplemented with 20 mEq of potassium chloride IV per liter of D5-1/2 NS. Insulin drip was initiated at a rate of 0.1 units/kg/hour. Finger stick blood glucose was checked hourly to maintain blood glucose between 150 and 200 mg/dL. Basic metabolic panel and BHB levels were checked at four-hour interval. After initial 4 liters of volume resuscitation, the patient's anion gap started to close and in 18 hours period her gap closed completely as shown in .\nThe patient was subsequently transitioned to subcutaneous insulin. Her mentation improved and she was extubated. After extubation patient confirmed that she was on a cocaine binge for 2 days and missed her insulin doses during that time. The patient was transferred out of medical intensive care unit and was discharged from hospital subsequently.",

        "Ground Truth Answer": "2.35714",
        "Ground Truth Explanation": "The formula for computing the delta ratio is delta gap (mEq/L)/(24 - bicarbonate mEq/L).\nTo compute the formula of the delta gap, the formula is anion gap (in mEq/L) - 12. The first step is to compute the patient's anion gap.\nThe formula for computing a patient's anion gap is: sodium (mEq/L) - (chloride (mEq/L)+ bicarbonate (mEq/L)).\nThe concentration of sodium is 137.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of chloride is 82.0 mEq/L. \nThe concentration of bicarbonate is 10.0 mEq/L. \nPlugging in these values into the anion gap formula gives us 137.0 mEq/L - (82.0 mEq/L + 10.0 mEq/L) = 45.0 mEq/L. Hence, The patient's anion gap is 45.0 mEq/L.Plugging in 45.0 mEq/L for the delta gap formula, we get 45.0 - 12 = 33.0 mEq/L. Hence, the patient's delta gap is 33.0 mEq/L.Plugging in the delta gap and the bicarbonate concentration for the delta ratio formula, we get 33.0 mEq/L / 14.0 mEq/L = 2.35714.
