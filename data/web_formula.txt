CrCl (mL/min) = ((140 - age) × weight × gender_coefficient) / (72 × serum creatinine in mg/dL), where gender_coefficient = 1 if male, 0.85 if female, and the weight used depends on BMI as follows: if BMI < 18.5 (underweight), use actual body weight; if BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9 (normal weight), use ideal body weight (IBW); if BMI ≥ 25 (overweight/obese), use adjusted body weight (ABW). Ideal body weight is calculated using the Devine formula: IBW (kg) = 50 + 2.3 × (height in inches − 60) for males, IBW (kg) = 45.5 + 2.3 × (height in inches − 60) for females. Adjusted body weight is calculated as: ABW (kg) = IBW + 0.4 × (actual body weight − IBW).

Stage A (at risk for heart failure) is defined as a patient without symptoms, structural heart disease, or cardiac biomarkers of stretch or injury but who has chronic condition(s) that put them at increased risk. These conditions include HTN, DM, atherosclerotic CVD, metabolic syndrome and obesity, exposure to cardiotoxic drugs, genetic variant carrier for cardiomyopathy, or a positive family history of cardiomyopathy.
Stage B (pre-heart failure) is defined as evidence of one of the following
AND
no symptoms or signs of heart failure.
1. Structural heart disease includes:
Reduced left or right ventricular systolic function (ie reduced ejection fraction or reduced strain)
Ventricular hypertrophy
Chamber enlargement
Wall motion abnormalities
Valvular heart disease
2. Evidence of increased filling pressures can be confirmed with:
Invasive hemodynamic measurements
or
Noninvasive imaging such as echocardiography
3. Patients with risk factors
AND
either
Increased BNP
or
Persistently elevated cardiac troponin
Stage C (symptomatic heart failure) is defined as structural heart disease with current or previous symptoms of heart failure.
Stage D (advanced heart failure) is defined as marked symptoms of heart failure that interfere with daily life and lead to recurrent hospitalizations, despite goal directed medical therapy (GDMT).

To be diagnosed with acute kidney injury by the AKIN definition, patient must have at least one of the following within the past 48 hours:
Absolute increase in serum creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dL (≥26.4 μmol/L).
Increase in serum creatinine ≥1.5x above baseline.
Oliguria (urine output <0.5 mL/kg per hour) for >6 hours.
Then, select the appropriate criterion leading to the highest possible stage, e.g. if serum creatinine is normal but urine output is <0.5 mL/kg/hour for >12 hours, AKIN Stage is 2.

*Note: the original validation (
Miller 2013
) examined 6 parameters: age, temperature, leukocyte count, albumin, serum creatinine, and systemic antibiotics. The combination of parameters which led to the greatest discrimination among risk groups and correlation with cure was the five excluding temperature, and MDCalc uses this version for that reason.

Absolute neutrophil count = 10 x WBC count x (%
PMNs
+ % bands)
Note: assumes WBC count in 1,000s (i.e., x 10³ cells/µL, also equivalent to x 10³ cells/mm³).
Example, normal patient:
CBC shows WBC 9.2 (units are x 10³ cells/µL), 33% neutrophils, and 1% bands.
ANC = 10 x 9.2 x (33 + 1)
ANC = 10 x 9.2 x 34
ANC = 3,128 cells/µL → normal, no neutropenia
Example, neutropenic patient:
CBC shows WBC 1.0 (units are x 10³ cells/µL), 11% neutrophils, and 5% bands.
ANC = 10 x 1 x (11 + 5)
ANC = 160 cells/µL → severe neutropenia

To compute the ASPECTS, 1 point is subtracted from 10 for any evidence of early ischemic change for each of the defined regions.
A normal CT scan receives an ASPECTS of 10 points.
An ASPECTS of ≤7 points highly correlates with negative functional outcome, determined by
Modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
.
An ASPECTS of 0 indicates diffuse involvement throughout the MCA territory.
Subcortical structures are allotted 3 points (C, L, and IC). MCA cortex is allotted 7 points (insular cortex, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M6).
Regions:
C - Caudate
IC - Internal Capsule
L - Lentiform nucleus
I - Insular ribbon
M1 - Anterior MCA cortex
M2 - MCA cortex lateral to the insular ribbon
M3 - Posterior MCA cortex
M4*
M5*
M6*
*Anterior, lateral and posterior MCA territories immediately superior to M1, M2 and M3, rostral to basal ganglia.

Algorithm, as follows:
Are there signs of envenomation?
Signs include:
Swelling, tenderness, redness, ecchymosis, or blebs at bite site.
Elevated protime, decreased fibrinogen or platelets.
Systemic signs (hypotension, bleeding beyond puncture site, refractory vomiting, diarrhea, angioedema, neurotoxicity).
If YES, proceed to 2.
If NO, this is an apparent dry bite or no bite. Observe patient ≥8 hours, repeat labs prior to discharge, and do not administer antivenom.
Check for indications for antivenom:
Swelling that is more than minimal and is progressing.
Elevated protime, decreased fibrinogen or platelets.
Any systemic signs.
If YES, proceed to 3.
If NO, this is an apparent minor envenomation. Observe patient 12-24 hours, repeat labs at 4-6 hrs and prior to discharge, and do not administer antivenom.
Administer antivenom:
Establish IV access, give IV fluids.
Mix 4-6 vials of crotaline Fab antivenom in 250 mL NS and infuse over 1 hour.
Increase dose to 6-8 vials for patients in shock or with serious active bleeding.
Reexamine after 1 hour, and proceed to 4.
Check for control of envenomation (after initial antivenom):
Swelling and tenderness not progressing.
Protime, fibrinogen, platelets normal or clearly improving.
Clinically stable.
Neurotoxicity resolved or clearly improving.
If YES, monitor patient and perform serial examinations and maintenance therapy (2 vials of antivenom every 6 hours x 3 doses (given 6, 12, and 18 hours after initial control). Maintenance therapy may not be needed if close observation by physician expert is available.
If NO, then repeat antivenom until control is achieved.

Initial dose:
Pediatric: 0.02 mg/kg, up to adult dose.
Adult, mild toxicity: 1-2 mg.
Adult, severe toxicity (hemodynamic compromise, unconsciousness): 3-5 mg.
Assess for atropinization every 5 minutes:
Clear lung exam on auscultation is the most important factor.
Additional factors: heart rate >80, systolic blood pressure >80.
If atropinization has not been achieved, double previous dose and reassess in another 5 minutes.
Repeat doubling every 5 minutes until atropinization achieved.
Once atropinization achieved, begin continuous infusion at an hourly rate of 10% of the
sum
of all doses necessary to achieve initial atropinization.
Titrate as necessary.

Examine the patient using the 4 physical exam screening (answered Yes/No)questions of the BJH-SDS:
If the answer to any of the screening questions (
GCS
<13, Facial, Tongue, or Palatal Asymmetry/Weakness) is “YES” then the remainder of the screen should be stopped and the patient should be referred to speech pathology for further evaluation.
If the answer to all 4 screening questions is no, the the patient should be given a 3oz of water to swallow in sequential drinks.
Assess for throat clearing, cough or voice change during the initial swallowing and at 1 minute after.
If any of these are present, refer to speech pathology.
If patient tolerates water swallow without any of the above symptoms then they can be started on a regular diet.

Note: The Basal Energy Expenditure must be multiplied by activity and stress factors to calculate total caloric requirement.
BEE, kcal/day (male) = 66.5 + (13.75 × weight, kg) + (5.003 × height, cm) - (6.775 × age)
BEE, kcal/day (female) = 655.1 + (9.563 × weight, kg) + (1.850 × height, cm) - (4.676 × age)
Harris-Benedict adjustment:
Sedentary (little to no exercise) = BEE × 1.2
Light exercise (1-3 days per week) = BEE × 1.375
Moderate exercise (3–5 days per week) = BEE × 1.55
Heavy exercise (6–7 days per week) = BEE × 1.725
Very heavy exercise (twice per day, extra heavy workouts) = BEE × 1.9

Note: Although the calculator uses percentages for clinical context (e.g. 67% instead of 0.67), formulae are displayed below in ratios for simplicity.
Diagnostic test:
A = true positives
B = false positives
C = false negatives
D = true negatives
Prevalence (or pre-test probability) = (A + C) / (A + B + C + D)
Sensitivity = A / (A + C)
Specificity = D / (B + D)
Negative likelihood ratio = (1 – sensitivity) / specificity
Positive likelihood ratio = Sensitivity / (1 – specificity)
Pre-test odds = Prevalence / (1 – prevalence)
Post-test odds = Prevalence × likelihood ratio
Post-test probability = Post-test odds / (1 + post-test odds)
Positive predictive value = A / (A + B)
Or, (sensitivity × prevalence) / [(sensitivity × prevalence) + (1 – specificity) × (1 – prevalence)
Negative predictive value = D / (C + D)
Or, specificity × (1 – prevalence) / [(1 – sensitivity) × prevalence + specificity × (1 – prevalence)]
Treatment
:
Experimental event rate*, EER = A / (A + B)
Control event rate**, CER = C / (C + D)
Relative risk, RR = EER / CER
Odds ratio, OR = (A / B) / (C / D)
Absolute risk reduction, ARR = EER – CER
Number needed to treat, NNT = 1 / ARR
Relative risk reduction, RRR = ARR / CER
*Risk of outcome (absolute risk) in the experimental group
**Risk of outcome (absolute risk) in the control group.
If ARR <0, then it is an absolute risk
increase
.
If NNT <0, then it is the number needed to
harm

Example (highlighted cell):
To convert 1 mg Xanax to Librium, multiply 1 mg x 25. For a range of equipotent doses, multiply by 15 and 50.
1 mg Xanax ≈ 25 mg Librium
15-50 mg ≈ range of Librium dose equipotent to 1 mg Xanax

To be classified as a BRUE, all of the following must be true:
Infant <1 year old.
Asymptomatic on presentation (no URI symptoms, no fever).
No explanation for the event after conducting history and physical (e.g. GER, feeding difficulties).
History of sudden, brief, and now resolved episode consisting of ≥1 of the following:
Cyanosis or pallor.
Absent, decreased, or irregular breathing.
Marked change in tone (hyper or hypotonia).
Altered level of responsiveness.
Then, for a BRUE to be classified as low risk, all of the following must also be true:
Episode duration <1 minute.
>2 months of age.
No history of prematurity.*
No prior BRUE.
No need for CPR by medical provider.
*≥32 weeks gestational age or ≥45 weeks postconceptional age for infants born at <32 weeks.

Morphology criteria (based on
Brugada et al., 1991
):
If the QRS is upward in lead V1 (RBBB pattern),
then VT is suggested in the following situations:
V1: monophasic R, QR, or RS.
V6: R:S <1, or monophasic R, QR, or QS.
If the QRS is downward in lead V1 (LBBB pattern),
then VT is suggested in the following situations:
V1 or 2: R wave duration >30 ms or RS >60 ms wide.
V6: QR or QS.

CT of the head is required only for children with minor head injury* and any one of the following findings:
High risk (need for neurologic intervention)
GCS
<15 at two hours after injury.
Suspected open or depressed skull fracture.
History of worsening headache.
Irritability on examination.
Medium risk (brain injury on CT scan)
Any sign of basal skull fracture (e.g., hemotympanum, “raccoon” eyes, otorrhea or rhinorrhea of the cerebrospinal fluid, Battle’s sign).
Large, boggy hematoma of the scalp.
Dangerous mechanism of injury (e.g., motor vehicle collision, fall from ≥3 ft (91 cm) or 5 stairs, fall from bicycle with no helmet).
*Minor head injury is defined as injury within the past 24 hours associated with witnessed loss of consciousness, definite amnesia, witnessed disorientation, persistent vomiting (more than one episode) or persistent irritability (in a child <2 years) with GCS 13–15.

*Include all variables in scoring where “ED visits per year” is greater than or equal to the threshold. If “ED visits per year” does not meet the threshold requirement, count variable as 0. For example, if ED visits per year is ≥43,012, final CEDOCS Score = CEDOCS Score + A + B.
Note: Final CEDOCS Score is multiplied by the scaling factor specified. If no scaling factor or a scaling factor of 0 is specified, final CEDOCS Score is multplied by 2.

A CT head is required if any of the following criteria are present:
History
Witnessed loss of consciousness of >5 min duration.
History of amnesia (either antegrade or retrograde) of >5 min duration.
Abnormal drowsiness (defined as drowsiness in excess of that expected by the examining doctor).
≥3 vomits after head injury (a vomit is defined as a single discrete episode of vomiting).
Suspicion of non‐accidental injury (NAI, defined as any suspicion of NAI by the examining doctor).
Seizure after head injury in a patient who has no history of epilepsy.
Examination
Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) <14, or GCS <15 if <1 year old.
Suspicion of penetrating or depressed skull injury, or tense fontanelle.
Signs of a basal skull fracture (defined as evidence of blood or cerebrospinal fluid from ear or nose, panda eyes, Battle's sign, hemotympanum, facial crepitus, or serious facial injury).
Positive focal neurologic sign (defined as any focal neurologic sign, including motor, sensory, coordination, or reflex abnormality).
Presence of bruise, swelling or laceration >5 cm if <1 year old.
Mechanism
High‐speed road traffic accident either as pedestrian, cyclist or occupant (defined as accident with speed >40 mph).
Fall of >3 m in height.
High‐speed injury from a projectile or an object.
If none of the above variables are present, the patient is at low risk of intracranial pathology.

| Age                                                      | Venous thromboembolism israrein children and young adults unless they have strong predisposing risk factors. These may include cancer, trauma, indwelling lines , systemic infection, or family history of thrombosis. Patients who are greater than40 yearsof age remain at significantly increased risk compared to younger patients and the risk approximately doubles with each subsequentdecade.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Type of surgery                                          | Minor surgery does not refer totype of surgerybut rather length of anesthesia <45 minutes. Major surgery is defined as procedures withgeneralor regional anesthesia>45minutes are included. These include open, laproscopic, or arthroscopic procedures.Reoperationsduring the same hospitalization count for 2 points each if the anesthesia time exceeds 45 minutes. Major lower extremity arthroplasties are high-risk procedures if additional risk factors are present that further increases the risk. It has been shown that once the score reaches≥10the VTE risk is significantlygreater. If the procedure is being done as a result of a hipfracture, preoperative screening may be beneficial. |

| Hip, pelvis, or leg fracture                             | These fractures are associated with an increased risk of VTE and the degree of risk varies with location of thefracture. Although no clear guidelines are available, the presence of additional risk factors increases the degree of thrombotic risk. The incidence of pulmonary emboli may occur with equal frequency for above vs. below knee thrombosis and temporary IVC filters can prevent these emboli depending upon the clinicalcircumstances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Stroke                                                   | Stroke is the 3rd leading cause of death and frequently leads tovenous thromboembolism. A paradoxical embolus can occur in a patient from a DVT that travels to the heart and through a patent foramenovale(PFO) entering the systemic circulation leading to a thrombotic stroke. Another common cause of an embolic stroke occurs in patients withatrial fibrillation. Thrombotic strokes in the past should be counted as a previous thrombosis and scored as 3points.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Chemotherapy                                             | VTE incidence is increased in patients treated withchemotherapy. Incidental VTE is a relative common finding in patients with solid tumors, especially in the first months ofchemotherapy. Patients withmultiple myelomaare at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), especially when treated with thalidomide and lenalidomide, in combination with dexamethasone and/or chemotherapy.Neoadjuvant therapyfor cancer is associated with an increased risk of VTE. Current ASCO guidelines address the use of chemotherapy in a wide variety of clinicalscenariosin patients with cancer.                                                                                                      |

| Superficial venous thrombosis (SVT)                      | SVT is a risk factor for VTE particularly in conjunction with other risk factors. Roach, R. et al. report that “superficial vein thrombosis combined with an acquired thrombotic risk factor increases the risk of venous thrombosis10 to 100-fold.” Frequently isolated SVT progresses toDVTand PE. Cancer patients with SVT have a poor prognosis similar to cancer patients with DVT, and a high rate of recurrence is alsoobserved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Morbidity was defined as any of the following (
Dupuis 2001
):
Cardiovascular
: low cardiac output, hypotension, or both treated with intraaortic balloon pump, with two or more intravenous inotropes or vasopressors for more than 24 h, or with both, malignant arrhythmia (asystole and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation, antiarrhythmia therapy, or automatic cardiodefibrillator implantation
Respiratory
: mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h, tracheostomy, reintubation
Neurologic
: focal brain injury with permanent functional deficit, irreversible encephalopathy
Renal
: acute renal failure requiring dialysis
Infectious
: septic shock with positive blood cultures, deep sternal or leg wound infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, surgical debridement, or both
Other
: any surgery or invasive procedure necessary to treat a postoperative adverse event associated with the initial cardiac surgery
Examples of complex surgery (
Dupuis 2001
):
Reoperation
Combined valve and coronary artery surgery
Multiple valve surgery
Left ventricular aneurysmectomy
Repair of VSD after MI
CABG of diffuse or heavily calcified vessels
Other, as judged by clinicians

CDR is scored based on 6 categories where memory (M) is the primary category and orientation (O), judgment and problem solving (JPS), community affairs (CA), home and hobbies (HH), and personal care (PC) are secondary categories defined in the table below.
a
When M ≥1, CDR cannot be 0; in this circumstance, CDR = 0.5 when the majority of secondary categories are 0.
b
X = score of majority of secondary categories on the side of M that has the greater number of secondary categories. With ties in the secondary categories on one side of M, CDR = tied score closest to M (e.g. if M and another secondary category = 3, two secondary categories = 2, and two secondary categories = 1, then CDR = 2).
c
When 1-2 secondary categories have the same score as M, CDR = M as long as ≤2 secondary categories are on either side of M.

Dose, units = desired fibrinogen increment, mg/dL × (plasma volume, mL / 100) / 250 mg/unit
Where desired fibrinogen increment = goal fibrinogen – initial fibrinogen
and plasma volume = (1 – hematocrit) × 70 mL/kg × weight, kg
Note: the equation used here assumes a typical fibrinogen content of 250 mg per unit of cryo. As a biological product, fibrinogen content can vary somewhat from unit-to-unit, but should contain at least 150 mg / unit.

| A.Exposure.Exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence in ≥1 of the following ways (may be multiple events):Directly experiencing the event.Witnessing the event in person as it occurred to others.Learning that the traumatic event occurred to a close family member/close friend. If actual/threatened death of a family member or friend, event must have been violent or accidental.Experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event (e.g. first responders collecting human remains or police officers repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). Does not apply to exposure through electronic media, TV, movies, or pictures, unless this exposure is work related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| B. Intrusion symptoms.≥1 of the following associated with the traumatic event, beginning after the traumatic event occurred:Recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive distressing memories of the traumatic event. In children, repetitive play may occur where themes/aspects of the traumatic event are expressed.Recurrent distressing dreams where content and/or affect of dream are related to the traumatic event. In children, there may be frightening dreams without recognizable content.Dissociative reactions, e.g. flashbacks, where individual feels or acts as if the traumatic event were recurring. May occur on a continuum, with the most extreme expression being complete loss of awareness of present surroundings.

Number of vials = ( amount ingested, mg / 0.5 mg/vial ) x 80% bioavailability
Number of vials should always be rounded up to the next whole number.
Empiric therapy for acute poisoning:
10-20 vials (adult or child)
Empiric therapy for chronic poisoning:
Adult: 3-6 vials
Child: 1-2 vials
Example: 60-year old woman (65 kg) develops acute kidney injury from gastroenteritis and presents to the ED with altered mental status and bradycardia. Her serum digoxin level is 2.8 ng/mL (3.6 nmol/L). How many vials of DigiFab should be administered?
No. of vials = ( serum digoxin level, ng/mL x patient weight, kg ) / 100
No. of vials = 2.8 ng/mL x 65 kg / 100
No. of vials = 1.82 = 2 vials
(No. of vials should be rounded up)
Example: a 30-year old man (70 kg) presents to the ED after intentionally ingesting 4 mg of a family member’s digoxin. Atropine IV is ineffective and his heart rate remains 20-30. How many vials of DigiFab should be administered?
No. of vials = ( amount ingested, mg / 0.5 mg/vial ) x 80% bioavailability
No. of vials = 4 mg / 0.5 (mg/vial) x 80%
No. of vials = 6.4 = 7 vials

Selection of the appropriate criteria (all 4 must be present):
Ischemic stroke detected by CT or MRI that is not lacunar*.
Absence of extracranial or intracranial atherosclerosis causing ≥50% luminal stenosis in arteries supplying the area of ischemia.
No major risk cardioembolic source of embolism**.
No other specific cause of stroke identified (e.g. arteritis, dissection, migraine/vasospasm, drug abuse).
Note:
diagnosis of ESUS requires a minimum diagnostic evaluation, including cardiac monitoring for >24 hours with automated rhythm detection, in addition to the above criteria.
*Lacunar = subcortical infarct ≤1.5 cm (≤2.0 cm on MRI diffusion images) in largest dimension, including on MRI diffusion-weighted images, and in distribution of small, penetrating cerebral arteries of cerebral hemispheres and pons.
**Permanent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, sustained atrial flutter, intracardiac thrombus, prosthetic cardiac valve, atrial myxoma or other cardiac tumors, mitral stenosis, recent (<4 weeks) MI, left ventricular ejection fraction <30%, valvular vegetations, or infective endocarditis.

Addition of the selected points; points assigned below. If score is <16, patient can be evaluated in the “low risk” group with non-ischemic EKG and negative 0-hr and 2-hr troponins. These patients with these two additional features are low-risk for major adverse cardiac event.
If score is ≥16 or EKG shows new ischemia or 0-hr troponin is negative, then the patient is not low-risk and not appropriate for early discharge (obviously if the first troponin is negative and the patient is in the low-risk group, but the second troponin is positive, this patient no longer qualifies as low-risk).

[C] is serum concentration (mg/L).
Dose is amount ingested (mg).
Vd is volume of distribution (L/kg).
Weight is patient body weight (kg).
Example: a 3-year-old boy (15 kg) ingests 30 mL of windshield washer fluid (50% methanol). Maximal predicted serum methanol concentration:
[C] = Dose / (Vd × Weight)
Dose:
50% methanol = 50 g/100 mL = 500 mg/mL and
500 mg/mL × 30 mL ingested = 15,000 mg methanol
[C] = 15,000 mg / (0.6 L/kg × 15 kg) = 1,667 mg/L

EDSS:
Points assigned based on level of disability.
FSS:
Addition of selected points within body system.
The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) works together with the Functional Systems Scale (FSS) to measure MS disease progression.
The EDSS assesses the disability status of MS patients on a scale from 0 to 10.
Scores from 0 to 3.5 are determined by deficits in eight Functional Systems (FS) in patients who do not have any impairment of ambulation.
Scores from 4.0 to 10.0 are determined both by ambulatory ability and FS deficits, which typically correlate with each other.
Some providers use only the ambulatory score to determine the overall EDSS score between 4.0 and 10.0.
In situations when there is subjectivity and FS deficits do not correspond to a specific EDSS level, a range is provided.

Score interpretation:
A score of 0-1 is associated with 13-18% isolation of streptococcus (close to background carriage rates).
No antibiotics recommended.
A score of 2 is associated with 30-35% isolation of streptococcus.
Delayed antibiotic may be appropriate.
A score of 3 is associated with 39-48% isolation of streptococcus.
Delayed antibiotic may be appropriate.
A score of 4 or more is associated with 62-65% isolation of streptococcus.
Consider antibiotics if symptoms are severe or a short delayed prescribing strategy may be appropriate (48 hours).

Free water deficit, L = (% total body water, fraction)*(Weight, kg)*([Current sodium/Ideal sodium] – 1)
where % total body water (TBW) is:
Adult male: 60% (i.e., use 0.6 in the equation)
Adult female: 50% (0.5)
Elderly male: 50% (0.5)
Elderly female: 45% (0.45)
Child: 60% (0.6)
This formula calculates the total solute in the patient’s total body water and then determines how much water needs to be added to dilute it to the desired serum sodium.
Sufficient free water should be provided either orally or intravenously (e.g., 5% dextrose) to correct the serum sodium by up to 10 mEq/L in the first 24 hours.

Grade 1
The nuclei of the tumor cells are small (< 10 µm), hyperchromatic, and round (resembling mature lymphocytes), with no visible nucleoli and little detail in the chromatin, as shown in the image below.
Grade 2
Using the 10× objective, the nuclei of the tumor cells are slightly larger (15 µm) with finely granular “open” chromatin but small, inconspicuous nucleoli (see the following image). The nucleoli are often present, and many appear as small chromocenters at 10× objective, with confirmation of their nature at higher power, but this does not count.
Grade 3
Using the 10× objective, the nuclei of the tumor cells are larger (20 µm in size) and may be oval in shape, with coarsely granular chromatin (see the image below). The nucleoli are easily unequivocally recognizable.
Grade 4
The nuclei are pleomorphic with open chromatin or hyperchromatic and single or multiple macronucleoli, as depicted in the following image:

The Gail Model is one of the oldest risk models—originally published in 1989—and well validated.
These parameters were used as criteria for the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) prevention trials to identify patients with increased risk of breast cancer (5 year risk of >1.7%).
Lifetime risk estimates assume a life expectancy of 90 years.

The Revised Geneva scores, along with the
Wells’ PE criteria
are the most commonly used scores to evaluate for pulmonary embolism. Some physicians prefer the Revised Geneva score because of its objectivity, since the Wells’ score heavily weighs the subjective "PE Is #1 Diagnosis, or Equally Likely" value.
Interestingly, Penaloza et. al's study (see below) comparing Wells to Revised Geneva to clinician gestalt found that clinician gestalt faired comparably (and possibly even favorably) to these scores as well.
Why is the original Geneva Score not used or included on MDCalc? It requires both a chest x-ray and arterial blood gas and has fallen out of favor given the need for this testing and interpretation of it prior to being able to apply the rule.

, one involving simple addition of points and dichotomous variables, and one with continuous variables. The latter was found to be more accurate and so is presented here. Hypertension was included in the simple model but not found to be significant in the complex model and therefore is excluded.

Insulin bolus:
Intravenous bolus of regular insulin at a dose of
1 unit/kg
.
If serum glucose <250 mg/dL, concurrently administer a bolus of dextrose 25-50 g (or 0.5-1 g/kg) IV.
Note:
the calculator assumes D50 (50% dextrose in water) will be given for the initial bolus, and uses the weight-based dosing (0.5-1 g dextrose per kg patient weight; i.e., 1-2 cc D50 per kg patient weight).
HIET continuous infusion:
Regular insulin: start 0.5–1 unit/kg/hr.
Dextrose: 0.5 g/kg/hr (titrate to maintain glucose 110–250 mg/dL).
If fluid overload is a concern, the insulin can be concentrated to 10 units/mL.
If hypoglycemia does occur, bolus with dextrose and/or increase dextrose infusion first before considering a decrease or cessation of insulin infusion.
Continuous monitoring:
Serum glucose every 30 minutes for 1-2 hours until stable.
Potassium every 1 hour.

Distinction between 0 and 1 is of critical importance. Score 1 means that the symptom is judged as present in the patient’s history by the interviewer but does not qualify for a score 2 or more.
* Consultation only: the patient sought medical evaluation and was either referred to a specialist or offered detailed laboratory investigation.
** E.g., 1 extraction/surgery resulting in bleeding (100%): the score to be assigned is 2; 2 extractions/surgeries, 1 resulting in bleeding (50%): the score to be assigned is 2; 3 extractions/surgeries, 1 resulting in bleeding (33%): the score to be assigned is 2; 4 extractions/surgeries, 1 resulting in bleeding (25%): the score to be assigned is 1.

Ideal Body Weight (Devine formula):
Ideal body weight (IBW) (men) = 50 kg + 2.3 kg x (height, in - 60)
Ideal body weight (IBW) (women) = 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg x  (height, in - 60)
Note: this formula is only an approximation, and is generally only applicable for people 60 inches (5 foot) tall or greater. For patients under 5 feet, one commonly-used modification is to subtract 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches (written communication with leading expert Dr. Manjunath Pai, 2018).
Adjusted Body Weight (ABW), for use in obese patients (where actual body weight > IBW):
ABW = IBW + 0.4 x (actual body weight - IBW)

Morphology of megakaryocytes in pre-PMF and overt PMF usually demonstrates a higher degree of megakaryocytic atypia than in any other MPN subtype; distinctive features of megakaryocytes include small to giant megakaryocytes with a prevalence of severe maturation defects (cloud-like, hypolobulated, and hyperchromatic nuclei) and presence of abnormal large dense clusters (mostly >6 megakaryocytes lying strictly adjacent).
It is recommended to use highly sensitive assays for
JAK2
V617F (sensitivity level <1%) and
CALR
and
MPL
(sensitivity level 1% to 3%); in negative cases, consider searching for noncanonical
JAK2
and
MPL
mutations.
Assessed by cytogenetics or sensitive NGS techniques; detection of mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms (eg,
ASXL1
,
EZH2
,
IDH1
,
IDH2
,
SF3B1
,
SRSF2
, and
TET2
mutations) supports the clonal nature of the disease.
Minimal reticulin fibrosis (grade 1) secondary to infection, autoimmune disorder or other chronic inflammatory conditions, hairy cell leukemia or another lymphoid neoplasm, metastatic malignancy, or toxic (chronic) myelopathies.
Monocytosis can be present at diagnosis or develop during the course of PMF; in these cases, a history of MPN excludes CMML, whereas a higher variant allelic frequency for MPN-associated driver mutations is supporting the diagnosis of PMF with monocytosis rather than CMML.

In the absence of a
KIT
mutation, particularly in cases with eosinophilia, the presence of tyrosine kinase gene fusions associated with myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and kinase gene fusion (M/LN-eo) must be excluded.
Round-cell well-differentiated morphology can occur in a small subset of cases. In these cases, the mast cells are often negative for CD25 and CD2 but positive for CD30.
To avoid “false negative” results, use of a high-sensitivity PCR assay for detection of
KIT
D816V mutation is recommended. If negative, exclusion of
KIT
mutation variants is strongly recommended in suspected SM.

“Poor outcome” was defined as any of the following:
Hypotension: systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg or need for pressor support to maintain BP.
Respiratory failure: PaO
2
<60 mmHg while breathing room air, or need for mechanical ventilation.
ICU admission.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation.
Confusion or altered mental state.
CHF seen on chest x-ray and requiring treatment.
Bleeding severe enough to require transfusion.
Arrhythmia or EKG changes requiring treatment.
Renal failure requiring investigation and/or treatment with IV fluids, dialysis, or any other intervention.
Other complications judged serious and clinically significant by the investigator.

GFR = 175 × Serum Cr
-1.154
× age
-0.203
× 1.212 (if patient is black*) × 0.742 (if female)
Use serum Cr in mg/dL for this formula.
From
Levey 2006
.
Note: the original MDRD study equation used a constant of 186, which the authors later revised to 175 to accommodate for standardization of creatinine assays over IDMS. The evidence doesn't seem to strongly suggest that the revised version is demonstrably better than the original (furthermore, the same authors of MDRD also developed the newer
CKD-EPI equations
, which are more accurate at a broader range of estimated GFR than the MDRD equations).
*Race may/may not provide better estimates of GFR; optional.

Per
OPTN policy, January 2016 (pages 4–5)
:
Candidates who are at least 12 years old receive an initial MELD(i) score equal to:
MELD(i) = 0.957
×
ln(Cr) + 0.378
×
ln(bilirubin) + 1.120
×
ln(INR) + 0.643
Then, round to the tenth decimal place and multiply by 10.
If MELD(i) > 11, perform additional MELD calculation as follows:
MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32
×
(137 – Na) –  [ 0.033
×
MELD(i)
×
(137 – Na) ]
Additional rules:
All values in US units (Cr and bilirubin in mg/dL, Na in mEq/L, and INR unitless).
If bilirubin, Cr, or INR is <1.0, use 1.0.
If any of the following is true, use Cr 4.0:
Cr >4.0.
≥2 dialysis treatments within the prior 7 days.
24 hours of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) within the prior 7 days.
If Na <125 mmol/L, use 125. If Na >137 mmol/L, use 137.
Maximum MELD = 40.
<<FORMULA END>>

<<FORMULA START>>
Original MELD Score = (0.957*ln(Serum Cr) + 0.378*ln(Serum Bilirubin) + 1.120*ln(INR) + 0.643 )*10 (if hemodialysis, value for Creatinine is automatically set to 4.0)
Note: If any score is <1, the MELD assumes the score is equal to 1.
This is the pre-2016 MELD which does not include serum sodium level, as non-US transplant societies are still using the original MELD formula. See the
newer MELD formula here.

*“Clinical attack” = monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings reflecting inflammatory demyelinating CNS event (focal or multifocal), subacute or acute, for ≥24 hrs, with or without recovery, and no fever or infection present. Attack, relapse, exacerbation, and clinically isolated syndrome (first episode) are all synonymous.
**“Objective clinical evidence” = abnormality on neurologic exam, imaging (MRI or optical coherence tomography), or visual evoked potentials, corresponding to anatomical location suggested by symptoms.

MELD (Original, Pre-2016)
= (0.957*ln(Serum creatinine) + 0.378*ln(Serum bilirubin) + 1.120*ln(INR) + 0.643)*10
(if hemodialysis, value for Creatinine is automatically set to 4.0)
Note: If any score is <1, the MELD assumes the score is equal to 1.
MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN):
Per OPTN policy, January 2016 (pages 4–5):
Candidates who are at least 12 years old receive an initial MELD(i) score equal to:
MELD(i) = 0.957*ln(Creatinine) + 0.378*ln(Bilirubin) + 1.120*ln(INR) + 0.643
Then, round to the tenth decimal place and multiply by 10.
If MELD(i) > 11, perform additional MELD calculation as follows:
MELD = MELD(i) + 1.32*(137 – Na) –  [0.033*MELD(i)*(137 – Na)]
MELD 3.0:
Candidates who are at least 18 years old at the time of registration receive an initial MELD score equal to
MELD 3.0
= 1.33*(Female) + 4.56*ln(Serum bilirubin) + 0.82*(137 - Sodium) – 0.24*(137 - Sodium)*ln(Serum bilirubin) + 9.09*ln(INR) + 11.14*ln(Serum creatinine) + 1.85*(3.5 – Serum albumin) – 1.83*(3.5 – Serum albumin)*ln(Serum creatinine) + 6
Candidates who are currently at least 12 years old and were less than 18 years old at the time of registration receive a MELD score equal to:
MELD 3.0
= 4.56*ln(Serum bilirubin) + 0.82*(137 - Sodium) – 0.24*(137 - Sodium)*ln(Serum bilirubin) + 9.09*ln(INR) + 11.14*ln(Serum creatinine) + 1.85*(3.5 – Serum albumin) – 1.83*(3.5 – Serum albumin) – 1.83*(3.5 – Serum albumin)*ln(Serum creatinine) + 7.33
Serum bilirubin, INR, and serum creatinine values below 1.0 are set to 1.0.
Sodium is limited to a range of 125-137 mEq/L, and if outside of these bounds, is set to the nearest limit.
Serum albumin is limited to a range of 1.5-3.5 g/dL, and if outside of these bounds, is set to the nearest limit.
The following candidates receive a creatinine value of 3.0 mg/dL:
Those with a creatinine value greater than 3.0 mg/dL.
Those who received two or more dialysis treatments within 7 days prior to the serum creatinine test.
Those who received 24 hours of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) prior to the serum creatinine test.
The MELD 3.0 score is rounded to the nearest integer.

Definite Alzheimer Disease:
Histopathologic evidence obtained from a biopsy or autopsy plus all criteria for Probable Alzheimer’s Disease (1-6 below).
Probable Alzheimer Disease
* (must have all 6):
Dementia established by clinical examination and documented by the Mini-Mental Test, Blessed Dementia Scale, or some similar examination, and confirmed by neuropsychological tests.
Deficits in ≥2 areas of cognition.
Progressive worsening of memory and other cognitive functions.
No disturbance of consciousness.
Onset at age >40 to <90 years.
Absence of systemic disorders or other brain diseases that in and of themselves could account for the progressive deficits in memory and cognition.
*Additionally, the diagnosis of Probable AD is supported by the following:
Progressive deterioration of specific cognitive functions such as language (aphasia), motor skills (apraxia), and perception (agnosia).
Impaired activities of daily living and altered patterns of behavior.
Family history of similar disorders, particularly if confirmed neuropathologically.
Lab results:
Normal lumbar puncture.
Normal pattern or nonspecific changes in
EEG
(e.g. increased slow-wave activity).
Cerebral atrophy on CT with progression documented by serial observation.
Features that make Probable AD diagnosis uncertain or unlikely:
Sudden, apoplectic onset.
Focal neurologic findings (e.g. hemiparesis, sensory loss, visual field deficits, and incoordination early in the course of the illness).
Seizures or gait disturbances at onset or very early in the course of the illness.
If neither of the above is fulfilled,
Possible Alzheimer Disease
(must have all 3):
Dementia syndrome, in the absence of other neurologic, psychiatric, or systemic disorders sufficient to cause dementia, and presence of variations in onset, in presentation, or in clinical course.
Presence of a second systemic or brain disorder sufficient to produce dementia but is not considered to be the cause of dementia.
A single, gradually progressive severe cognitive deficit is identified in the absence of other identifiable cause.

EOS risk at birth
= 1/(1 + e
-x
),
where
x
= Σ[β*(transformed variables)]
EOS risk per 1000/births
= (EOS risk at birth)*1000
EOS risk after clinical exam is calculated as follows:
EOS risk per 1000/births
= y/(1 + y) * 1000,
where
y
= z*[EOS risk at birth/(1 - EOS risk at birth)]
z is defined as follows:

The Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (ONLS) Score is calculated by the addition of the Arms grade score and the Legs grade score.
The Arms grade score is determined by the answers to the following questions:
Does the patient have any symptoms in their hands or arms, e.g. tingling, numbness or weakness?
If yes, is the patient affected in their ability to:
Wash and brush their hair?
Turn a key in a lock?
Use a knife and fork together (or spoon, if knife and fork not used)?
Do or undo buttons or zips?
Dress the upper part of their body excluding buttons or zips?
If all these functions are prevented, can the patient make purposeful movements with their hands or arms?
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| Symptoms                                                                                       | Arms grade score |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
The Legs grade score is determined by the answers to the following questions:
Does the patient have difficulty running or climbing stairs?
Does the patient have difficulty with walking?
Does their gait look abnormal?
How do they mobilize for about 10 m (33 ft)?
Without aid?
With one stick or crutches or holding to someone’s arm
With two sticks or crutches or one stick or crutch holding onto someone's arm or frame
With a wheelchair
If they use a wheelchair, can they stand and walk 1 m (3.28 ft) with the help of one person?
If they cannot walk as above are they able to make some purposeful movements of their legs, e.g. reposition legs in bed?
Does the patient use ankle foot orthoses/braces?

B = Pain Visual Analog Scale (ask patient to rate pain on a scale of 0-10, where 10 is worst pain imaginable).
C = Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (ask patient to rate how well they are doing in the past week considering all the ways their disease affects them on a scale of 0-10, where 10 is the worst).
*Categorical score is the highest selected score within a given category. Example: If patient can self-dress without any difficulty but shampoos hair with much difficulty, the categorical score for dress and groom is 2.

Total plasma dosage, mL = desired plasma dosage, mL/kg × weight, kg
Note the following:
Desired plasma dosage ranges from 10 to 20 mL/kg.
This dose is expected to increase the level of coagulation factors by 20% immediately after infusion.
A recommended standard dose of FFP is 10 mL/kg, but doses up to 15 or 20 mL/kg may be justified based on the clinical situation.

Risk is calculated using the clinical/genetic model from
Miron 2020
with the following variables:
Age, years.
Height, cm.
Weight, kg.
Maximum interventricular septal diameter, mm.
Maximum left ventricular (LV) posterior wall diameter, mm.
Left atrial (LA) diameter at end-systole, mm.
See
here
for details on how to measure.
Peak LV outflow tract gradient, mmHg.
History of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NVT) in prior 6 months (yes or no).
History of unexplained syncope in prior 6 months (yes or no).
Genotype status (not tested or tested).
If tested, mutation (negative, positive, or variant of uncertain significance).

Instructions:
Divide each lung on CT chest slice into quadrants as above.
Select the worst (i.e., highest) possible score for each quadrant. Example: presence of a small area of consolidation in a quadrant yields a score of 3, even if the remainder of the quadrant is not consolidated.
Add total RADS for each slice read, then divide by number of slices read per CT to obtain RADS per slice.

x = number of units required / frequency of units negative for the antigen
where x = minimum number of units to antigen type
Example for patients with single antibodies:
Four c-negative donors are required for a patient with anti-c.
The frequency of the c antigen is 80%.
x = 4 / (1 - 0.8) = 20
Answer: a minimum of 20 donors should be antigen typed.

The Rebound Hyperbilirubinemia Risk Score is calculated based on the following inputs:
Gestational age (GA) <38 weeks (yes or no).
Age at phototherapy initiation, hours.
Total serum bilirubin (TSB) at phototherapy termination.
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) phototherapy threshold is determined as follows:
+------------+----------------------+
| Age, hours | AAP Threshold, mg/dL |
+------------+----------------------+
| 25-48      | 15 mg/dL             |
+------------+----------------------+
| 49-72      | 18 mg/dL             |
+------------+----------------------+
| >72        | 20 mg/dL             |
+------------+----------------------+
Note: formula assumes TSB and AAP threshold units in mg/dL.
Rebound Hyperbilirubinemia Risk Score = 15*(GA <38 weeks) - 7*(age at phototherapy initiation, days) - 4*(AAP threshold - TSB) + 50

The Seattle Heart Failure Score is calculated by the following:
Seattle HF Score
= (age/10)*ln(1.09) + male*ln(1.089) + (NYHA class)*ln(1.6) + (100/(ejection fraction))*ln(1.03) + (if ischemic etiology)*ln(1.354) + (SBP/10)*ln(0.877) + (diuretic dose)*ln(1.178) + (if using allopurinol)*ln(1.571) + (if using statins)*ln(0.63) + (if using ACE inhibitors) + (if using beta-blockers)*ln(0.66) + (if using angiotensin receptor blockers)*ln(0.85) + (if using K-sparing diuretics)*ln(0.74) + (if using biventricular pacemaker) + (if using implantable cardioverter-defibrillator)*ln(0.73) + (if using biventricular implantable cardioverter-defibrillator)*ln(0.79) + (138 – sodium)*ln(1.05) + (100/(total cholesterol, mg/dL))*ln(2.206) + (hgb score) + ((% lymphocytes)/5)*ln(0.897) + (uric acid, mg/dL)*ln(1.064),
where
diuretic dose, mg/kg
= (furosemide + 2*torsemide + 26.7*b
umetanide
+ 40*metolazone + 3.2*hydrochlorothiazide)/(weight, kg)
This translates to the following equivalent doses used for this calculator (based on 80 mg of furosemide):
Torsemide: 40 mg.
Bumetanide: 3 mg.
Metolazone: 2 mg.
Hydrochlorothiazide: 25 mg.
If hemoglobin, g/dL <16 g/dL,
hgb score
= (16 – hemoglobin)*ln(1.124)
If hemoglobin, g/dL ≥16 g/dL,
hgb score
= (hemoglobin – 16)*ln(1.336)
Note:
Lymphocyte values >47% are set to 47%.
Uric acid values <3.4 mg/dL are set to 3.4 mg/dL.
SBP values >160 mm Hg are set to 160 mm Hg.
Sodium values >138 mEq/L are set to 138 mEq/L.

Experts recommend correcting
no faster than 12 mmol/L/day (0.5mmol/L/hr)
to avoid osmotic demylination syndrome (ODS), previously known as central pontine myelinolysis (CPM), and only correcting it faster — and only using hypertonic (3%) saline —
if the patient is seriously symptomatic at a rate of 1-2 mmol/L/hr
, and even then, only correcting it at 1-2 mmol/L/hr.
